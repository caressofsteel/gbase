      <p><strong>Early Years (mid - 60's to 1973)</strong> <br>
        <br>
        Alex began his
        musical training by practicing on a neighbor's violin.<br>
        When Alex was 12, his
        parents bought him an $11.00 Kent classical guitar for Christmas. <br>
        Alex, the
        ingenious rascal he is, took the tonearm of hs record player and jammed the
        needle into the wood of his Kent, <br>
        thereby creating his first amplifier, as
        well !<br>
        Realizing the need to get Alex a decent setup, his parents later
        bought him a Conora electric solidbody. <br>
        He had a small Kent amp, which he
        put the word "VOX" on in electrical tape !<br>
        As Rush formed in '68, Alex was
        borrowing various amps, including Geddy's Traynor. <br>
        Alex was also borrowing
        guitars, like a Harmony, and Ged's brother-in-law's Gibson Firebird.<br>
        In late
        '68, Alex bought a new tobacco sunburst Gibson ES-335. Soon, he also had a brown
        '63 Fender Stratocaster,<br>
        but Alex didn't care for it much and sold
        it.<br>
        Later, he would buy a Marshall 50-watt head and one 4x12" cabinet. This
        was to be his setup for quite awhile.<br>
        He also had a few effects, including a
        Fuzz Face distortion, a Maestro phaser,&nbsp;&nbsp;a Crybaby wah pedal, and an
        Echoplex.<br>

        <strong>RUSH</strong>
        <br>
        Gibson ES-335<br>
        Marshall JMP 50-watt half stack<br>
        Alex used a rented
        Rickenbacker 12-string acoustic on "Before and After"<br>
        effects as
        above<br>
        <br>
        <strong>RUSH TOUR (w/John Rutsey)<br>

        <br>
        <strong>RUSH TOUR (w/Neil Peart)<br>
        </strong>same as above, Alex
        bought a secnd Marshall amp and now had two full stacks of 4x12" cabinets.<br>
        He
        would also buy (but never use) a '74 Gibson Les Paul deluxe. This guitar had
        problems and was soon traded for a cherry sunburst '74 Gibson Les paul
        Standard.<br>
        _____________________________________________________________________________________<br>
        <br>
        <strong>FLY
          BY NIGHT<br>

        part on "Making Memories")<br>
        a borrowed Martin acoustic for "Making Memories,
        an acoustic overdub on "Fly By Night", <br>
        and again, the rented Rickenbacker
        12-string acoustic for "In the End"<br>
        His amps, in the studio, included the
        Marshall, and also a Fender Super Reverb.<br>
        Alex got a Morley Volume/Echo
        pedal, also for this album, and subsequent tours.<br>

        <br>
        <strong>CARESS
          OF STEEL</strong> <br>
        the 335 was used on everything, except on "Lakeside Park",
        which was a rented Fender Stratocaster.<br>
        Alex played a rented Fender pedal
        steel on parts of "The Necromancer", <br>
        and used a borrowed classical guitar on "Panacea".<br>
        Amps were the same as on FBN.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>CARESS OF STEEL
          TOUR</strong> <br>
        same as previous

        <br>
        <strong>2112<br>
        </strong>the
        335 was, again, the primary guitar, with occasional appearences by the Les Paul
        Std.<br>
        Amps were same as before, with a Fender Twin Reverb, also being
        used.<br>
        Alex now, also has a Gibson Dove 6-string acoustic, and a Gibson B-45
        12-string acoustic.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>2112 TOUR</strong> <br>
        For this tour, Alex
        would occasionally play a '74 Gibson Les Paul Std in tobacco-burst.<br>
        It had
        Pyramid pickups installed, but were later switched back to the stock
        pickups.<br>
        The 335 was also, still being
        used.<br>

        <br>
        <strong>ALL THE WORLDS A STAGE
          TOUR</strong> <br>
        pretty much the same setup as the previous tour.<br>
        Alex got
        his cherry red Gibson EDS-1175 doubleneck around this time, <br>
        and was using it
        late in the tour, on the pre-release version of "Xanadu", <br>
        and also on "A
        Passage to
        Bankok".<br>

        Initially, both
        doublenecks were touring, until the 1175 was damaged. <br>
        The ES-335 was also
        damaged, repaired, and retired.<br>

        <br>
        <strong>HEMISPHERES</strong>
        <br>
        Recorded were the 355, the 345, and a Roland GR-500 guitar synthesizer,
        <br>

        <br>
        _____________________________________________________________________________________<br>
        <br>
        <strong>PERMANENT
          WAVES</strong> <br>
        The black Strat now featured a very early Floyd Rose tremolo.
        <br>
        No locking nut was installed, rather, Alex used powdered graphite in the
        string slots to keep friction down.<br>
        Also, A Gibson humbucking pickup was
        installed in the bridge position.<br>
        This guitar was used on "The Spirit of
        Radio", and the lead on "Different Strings"<br>
        The 355 was used on everything
        else, with the exception of the leads on "Jacob's Ladder", which was the Pyramid
        guitar.<br>
        A new sunburst Gibson Howard Roberts Fusion was also used on "Different Strings".<br>
        Acoustics were the Gibson J-55 and the Dove in Nashville
        tuning.<br>
        In "Nashville tuning" the low E, A , and D strings are replaced with
        G, B, and, high E strings, respectively, and are tuned to E, A, and D,<br>
        except
        the E is now tuned the same as the other high E, and the A and D strings are
        tuned one octave higher than usual.<br>
        Amps were combinations of Marshalls,
        Hiwatts, <br>
        and Mesa/Boogies driving Marshall bottoms, and also the Leslie
        cabinet<br>
        Effects now include Loft analog delays and Maestro parametric
        filters, <br>
        in addition to the previous cast of
        characters.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>PERMANENT WAVES TOUR</strong> <br>
        Pretty much
        identical to the previous tour, with the addition of the new and improved
        blackStrat<br>
        Amps are also the same<br>
        Additional fx are described
        above.<br>
        _____________________________________________________________________________________<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MOVING
          PICTURES</strong> <br>
        The 355 was used on "Tom Sawyer" (the lead was played on
        the Howard Roberts) and on "Witch Hunt", <br>
        Otherwise the black Strat ("YYZ",
        "Vital Signs") along with two new Strats, <br>
        a red one ("The Camera Eye"),and a

        The acoustic on "The
        Camera Eye" was the Gibson Dove in Nashville tuning<br>
        Amps in the stuio were
        hiwatts, and also two Marshall 4140 combo amps were used.<br>
        New effects
        included Advanced Audio digital delays, Roland digital delays, an MXR
        distortion, and an MXR Micro-amp preamp.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>MOVING PICTURES TOUR
          (and EXIT...STAGE LEFT TOUR)<br>
        </strong>On this tour , Alex brought the 355,
        the Howard Roberts, the three Strats, and the 1275 dblnck.<br>
        Acoustics were
        Ovation Adamas classical and steel-strings.<br>
        Amps were the Hiwatt 100w heads
        driving two 4x12" cabs, and also the Leslie.<br>
        The two Marshall 4140 were also
        used.<br>
        Effects are the same, with the addition of those described
        above.<br>
        _____________________________________________________________________________________<br>
        <br>
        <strong>SIGNALS</strong>
        <br>
        The Strats were used in various combinations on every song, except for "Digital Man",<br>
        which used the Howard Roberts, which was now fitted with a
        Kahler tremolo unit.<br>
        The barely-audible acoustics on "Losing It" were the
        combination of the Dove in Nashville tuning, and the Adamas.<br>
        Amps in the
        studio, were now just the Marshall combo amps.<br>
        New effects included a
        Deltalab harmonizer(the solo on "The Analog Kid" uses this effect),<br>
        also
        Yamaha E1010 delays were used, and a Mutron octave divider(for the last part
        of
        the solo on "The Weapon").<br>
        <br>
        <strong>SIGNALS TOUR (and Radio City Music
          Hall shows)</strong> <br>
        The three Strats, and the Howard Roberts were the only
        electrics used.<br>
        A blond Fender Telecaster was used at the Radio City shows on "Kid Gloves", and "New
        World Man"<br>
        The Adamas steel-string and classical were
        the acoustics.<br>
        Amps were now just four Marshall 4140's.<br>
        New fx as
        described
        above.<br>
        _____________________________________________________________________________________<br>
        <br>
        <strong>GRACE
          UNDER PRESSURE</strong> <br>
        The Strats now have Shark necks on them, along with
        the infamous "Hentor Sportscaster" names.<br>
        The Tele was recorded on the rhythm
        track of "Kid Gloves"<br>
        Amps and effects are pretty much the same as
        before.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>GRACE UNDER PRESSURE TOUR (including pre-PoW
          tour)</strong> <br>
        almost identical to the previous tour, except the Howard
        Roberts was now
        retired.<br>
        _____________________________________________________________________________________<br>
        <br>
        <strong>POWER
          WINDOWS</strong> <br>
        Alex used his Strats, as usual, Adamas acoustics, and was
        now using Dean Markley amps in the studio.<br>
        New effects iclude various Roland
        digital reverbs and delays<br>
        Loft digital delays, Ibanez HD-1000
        Harmonizer/Delay, Boss Super Distortion, Boss Octaver, <br>
        Delta Lab ADM-2048

        <br>
        <strong>POWER
          WINDOWS TOUR</strong> <br>
        Identical to the studio setup, except for the amps,
        which were still the Marshal combos.<br>
        Late in the tour, Alex began using(and
        endorsing) Signature guitars.<br>
        These were Strat-style
        guitars.<br>
        _____________________________________________________________________________________<br>
        <br>
        <strong>HOLD
          YOUR FIRE</strong> <br>
        Alex recorded with the Signature Guitars, and would
        occasionally double the Tele, in with them.<br>
        The Adamas acoustics were also
        used. Gallien-Krueger, and Dean Markley amps were used.<br>
        Around this time,
        Alex recieved a prototype Roland Dimension D spatial expander.<br>
        This unit was
        never officially sold on the retail market.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>HOLD YOUR FIRE TOUR
          (and A SHOW OF HANDS album)</strong> <br>
        Alex took the three signature
        guitars(white, black, and a dark vermillion) on the road.<br>
        Acoustics, again
        were Adamas.<br>
        Amps were Gallien Kruegers.<br>
        Effect units remained the same,
        with the addition of the Dimension
        D.<br>
        _____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
      <p><br><strong>PRESTO</strong> <br>Alex, again used primarily the Signatures,

        "Nashville tuning" acoustic<br>Amps were combinations of Gallien-Kruegers,
        Carvins, and Rolands<br><br><strong>PRESTO TOUR<br></strong>Initially, the
        Signatures were used, but late in the tour, he was just using one Signature,
        <br>and had begun to use a tobacco-burst Paul Reed Smith with active single-coil
        pickups<br>He also had the black PRS with humbucking pickups, but hadn't yet
        used it onstage.<br>Adamas acoustics<br>For amps, the G-K's were still in use
