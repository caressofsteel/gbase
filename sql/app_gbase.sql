He started playing \r\n\r\nguitar at the age of 12\r\n  (After a brief fling at age 8 when he noticed his sister got to stay up late\r\n  for her organ lessons. His little plan didn’t work out being that \r\n\r\nhis\r\n  guitar lesson\r\n  was after school, and soon lost interest.) He quickly realized his influences\r\n  and was determined to reach their level of ability. Some early \r\n\r\ninfluences include\r\n  Yngwie Malmsteen, Randy Rhoads, Iron Maiden, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Yes, Rush etc.</p>\r\n  <p>As the rise of thrash & metal hit John, he\r\n    expanded his \r\n\r\ninfluences to include bands like Metallica & Queensryche.\r\n    Needing more of a technical challenge, his fingers demanded adapting the hammering\r\n    speed & melodic\r\n    style \r\n\r\nof players such as the Steves (Steve Morse & Steve Vai), the Als\r\n    (Allan Holdsworth & Al DiMeola), Mike Stern, Joe Satriani, Neal\r\n    Schon & Eddie Van Halen. His musical \r\n\r\neducation began with a great music\r\n    theory class he took in high school. Being primarily self taught, he did\r\n    receive a few lessons when he attended Berklee College of \r\n\r\nMusic in Boston,\r\n    where he\r\n    learned jazz composition and harmony. While at Berklee John and John Myung\r\n    who was also attending, met Mike Portnoy and started a band \r\n\r\ncalled Majesty\r\n    which would later turn into Dream Theater. </p>\r\n<p>John has recorded 7 albums with Dream Theater, and has also been involved\r\n  in several side projects \r\n\r\nincluding Liquid Tension Experiment with Tony Levin,\r\n  Age of Impact and even a Sega Saturn game called Necronomicon. His love for\r\n  lyric writing combined with his unique \r\n\r\ncomposing style of progressive fusion\r\n  shape the sound of Dream Theater. For a complete listing of his recordings\r\ncheck out his discography. </p>\r\n<p>John lives with his \r\n\r\nwife, Rena, and 3 children, SamiJo, Reny and Kiara in\r\n  New York.

Guitarist John Petrucci and his bassist\r\n  friend John Myung both attended the Berklee School \r\n\r\nof Music in Boston, and\r\n  they were looking to form a band in their spare time. They came across drummer\r\n  Mike Portnoy in one of Berklee\'s rehearsal rooms, and after a few \r\n\r\ndays chatting\r\n  they decided to give it a shot.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-serif\">They contacted high school friend Kevin Moore to fill the \r\n\r\nkeyboardist position,\r\n  and vocalist Chris Collins completed the line-up to be known as Majesty.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-serif\">The quintet \r\n\r\nstarted jamming in their free time, and recorded a short demo\r\n  tape consisting of 8 tracks to be distributed around the local area. The demo\r\n  tape was called the \'Majesty \r\n\r\nDemos\', and sold 1000 copies within the first\r\n  6 months of availability. Amazingly, the demos continued to be copied and distributed\r\n  by fans and is still widely available \r\n\r\ntoday.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-serif\">The following November, the band underwent their first in a long string of\r\n  line-up changes as Chris \r\n\r\nCollins and Majesty parted ways. In need of a singer,\r\n  the band continued writing and recording demos for about a year to follow,\r\n  and instrumental versions of some future DT \r\n\r\nclassics were conceived.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-serif\">Finally, in November 1987, the band recruited Charlie Dominici as their singer\r\n  and \r\n\r\nfrontman. Eager to professionally distribute their demoed material, the\r\n  band signed to Mechanic Records and started working on When Dream and Day Unite.</font></p>\r\n<p><font \r\n\r\nsize=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-serif\">Unfortunately, before they could get too far, they were contacted by a Las\r\n  Vegas band also called Majesty and were forced to \r\n\r\nchange their name. Names\r\n  were considered and discarded, until Howard Portnoy (Mike\'s father) suggested\r\n  they use the name Dream Theater, the name of a now demolished \r\n\r\nCalifornia cinema.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-serif\">When Dream and Day Unite was completed and distributed throughout the underground\r\n  prog \r\n\r\nscene, gathering quite a bit of support from starving prog rockers waiting\r\n  for another Yes- or Rush-esque masterpiece. Unfortunately, the band were restricted\r\n  to small clubs \r\n\r\nand bars as Mechanic lacked the size and funding to provide\r\n  a suitable tour program.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-serif\">Leaving Mechanic \r\n\r\nbehind them, Dream Theater fired Charlie and were after a\r\n  fresh start. Unfortunately, finding a suitable singer would set them back quite\r\n  a few years.</font></p>\r\n<p><font \r\n\r\nsize=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-serif\">Chris Cintron, John Arch, Steve Stone and John Hendricks among others were\r\n  all auditioned and declined until finally, in late \r\n\r\n1991, a tape arrived from\r\n  Canada. It was from glam band Winter Rose\'s vocalist, Kevin LaBrie, and the\r\n  band decided that they were interested enough to fly him down to New \r\n\r\nYork for\r\n  a proper audition. With Kevin, they performed demo versions of To Live Forever,\r\n  Learning to Live and Take the Time, and decided to pick him over the 200+ other\r\n  \r\n\r\nhopefuls for the vocal spot in Dream Theater.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-serif\">With 2 Johns and a Kevin already in the band, LaBrie decided to \r\n\r\nuse his middle\r\n  name, James, as his first name to side-step any confusion on the matter.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-serif\">ATCO Atlantic (now \r\n\r\nEastWest) signed DT for the recording of the one prog masterpiece\r\n  of the 1990s - Images and Words. Three videos were shot for the album, Pull\r\n  Me Under (a cheap live video \r\n\r\npaired with a totally unrelated story), Take the\r\n  Time, and Another Day. The band\'s hopes were with Another Day, the most radio\r\n  friendly of the bunch, but suprisingly it was \r\n\r\nPull Me Under that became an\r\n  MTV hit. In fact, Another Day still hasn\'t been played once on the station.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-\r\n\r\nserif\">Radio had already picked up on PMU, and IAW began to gather quite an amount\r\n  of sales. This was about the time that a lot of die-hard prog rock fans from\r\n  around \r\n\r\nAmerica became die-hard DT fans, and ATCO decide that it was time for\r\n  a live album and video.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-serif\">Live at the \r\n\r\nMarquee was recorded at the Marquee Club in London, and Live in\r\n  Tokyo was recorded in Tokyo (surprise surprise) during the Music In Progress\r\n  tour 1993. The enourmous DT \r\n\r\nbootleg trading community started to form around\r\n  this time, with the majority of DT shows around the world being recorded and\r\n  distributed.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" \r\n\r\nface=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-serif\">Returning from the biggest tour of their careers, the band started to record\r\n  their third studio album (and first with original material) in \r\n\r\nMay 1994. Awake\r\n  was completed in July the same year, but before the mixing was complete, Kevin\r\n  Moore turned the DT gang on their head. Citing musical differences, he \r\n\r\nannounced\r\n  his intentions to leave DT and concentrate on his solo music interests.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-serif\">To fill-in for the Waking \r\n\r\nUp The World tour, Derek Sherinian was hired until\r\n  they found a permanent replacement for Kevin. The band was mainly interested\r\n  in Julliard trained Jordan Rudess, but he had \r\n\r\nbeen offered a place by the Dixie\r\n  Dregs, who at the time suited Jordan\'s needs more closely. Jens Johansson (now\r\n  in Stratovarius) auditioned but was declined, and \r\n\r\neventually the band decided\r\n  to keep Derek on as full-time keyboardist.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-serif\">In April of 1995, after some serious \r\n\r\nprodding from fans, DT entered BearTracks\r\n  Studios once again to record the 23 minute epic A Change of Seasons. Written\r\n  originally in 1989, the song underwent some major \r\n\r\nstructural changes, and Derek\r\n  was given the opportunity to put his own spin on the keyboard parts. Eventually,\r\n  on September 19, 1995, the A Change of Seasons EP was released \r\n\r\nand highly acclaimed\r\n  by fans.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-serif\">A short mini-tour (the \'fix for 96\') was completed and DT took a few \r\n\r\nmonths\r\n  off before returning to the studio to write and record Falling Into Infinity.\r\n  Over 2 CDs worth of material was completed, including a follow-up to the IAW\r\n  epic \r\n\r\nMetropolis Part 1. Unfortunately, Elektra (their label at the time, and\r\n  current label) would not allow a double-CD, and the band were forced to put\r\n  an album\'s worth of \r\n\r\nmaterial into Mike\'s basement.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-serif\">After their enourmous Touring Into Infinity world tour, Dream Theater took\r\n  \r\n\r\na break. But as is the way with workaholic musicians, the members found other\r\n  projects to keep them busy for the year.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, \r\n\r\nsans-serif\">John Petrucci and Mike finally found a way of performing with Jordan Rudess,\r\n  in the form of the Liquid Tension Experiment (also featuring bass master Tony\r\n  \r\n\r\nLevin). Spearheaded by Magna Carta boss Mike Varney and Portnoy, this mainly\r\n  imrovised album became legendary among DT fans.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, \r\n\r\nArial, sans-serif\">John also performed lead guitar on Trent Gardner\'s Explorer\'s Club project,\r\n  and Derek contributed a solo. James was one of 4 vocalists to appear on the\r\n  \r\n\r\nalbum, and he also made a guest appearance on Shadow Gallery\'s third album,\r\n  Tyranny.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-serif\">John Myung and Derek \r\n\r\nSherinian collaborated with King\'s X frontman Ty Tabor\r\n  to create a band that can only be described as King\'s X with Derek Sherinian,\r\n  Platypus, and the debut album When Pus \r\n\r\nComes to Shove was recorded.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-serif\">Amongst all these side-projects, DT did find a way of releasing something,\r\n  in \r\n\r\nthe form of a live 2CD and video. The CD, entitled Once in a LIVEtime, was\r\n  recorded over 2 nights in Europe, and was made up of a very widely spread collection\r\n  of DT tunes. \r\n\r\nThe video contained live shows, studio exerpts, and a commentary\r\n  by Mike Portnoy from the IAW days right up until OIAL.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, \r\n\r\nsans-serif\">1999 started with some suprising news, with DT announcing that they had fired\r\n  Derek in favour of Jordan Rudess, who had finally become available. Derek went\r\n  on \r\n\r\nto record solo albums, guest spots, and form Planet X, one of the cornerstones\r\n  of the prog/modern-jazz fusion genre.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, \r\n\r\nsans-serif\">Around this time, DT fans caught wind of what Kevin Moore was doing when he\r\n  released a collection of old demos called This Is A Recording. Most of the\r\n  songs on \r\n\r\nthe demo were eventually re-recorded for Kevin\'s Chroma Key project\r\n  (of which there is now a sequel, and a third on the way).</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, \r\n\r\nArial, sans-serif\">James LaBrie was the last DT member without a side-project of some kind until\r\n  early 1999, when he started work on the MullMuzzler project with Matt \r\n\r\nGuillory\r\n  and Mike Mangini. Their album Keep It To Yourself was acclaimed amongst proggers,\r\n  but would be overshadowed by DT\'s next contribution to rock \r\n\r\nhistory.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-serif\">Elektra had finally decided to give DT 100% creative freedom with their next\r\n  album, and the result \r\n\r\nwas one of the few legendary prog rock albums ever written.\r\n  Scenes From A Memory, the 77 minute rock opera epic was released in late 1999,\r\n  and was hailed as the best concept \r\n\r\nalbum since Queensryche\'s Operation: Mindcrime.\r\n  Yet another world tour followed, and DT\'s first ever DVD release was conceived.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet \r\n\r\nMS, Arial, sans-serif\">Metropolis 2000 was finally released after a very anxious wait from fans,\r\n  but unfortunately the months following were filled with problems and crises.\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe first of which was a synchronization problem with PAL versions of the DVD,\r\n  resulting in recalls and more anxious waiting until finally a new batch were\r\n  release \r\n\r\npersonally approved by Mike Portnoy himself.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-serif\">As a gift to fans who did not own DVD players, Mike decided to \r\n\r\nrelease a triple\r\n  live album with the entire Metropolis 2000 concert. Once again however, it\r\n  was not a smooth release. The album was released on September 11, 2001 - a\r\n  \r\n\r\ntragic day by it\'s own accord, but DT somehow managed to inadvertently make\r\n  some matters worse by giving the CD somewhat inappropriate artwork. The front\r\n  cover was DT\'s \r\n\r\n\'sacred heart\' insignia from the IAW days transformed into a\r\n  burning apple, with the NY skyline amongst the flames. Unfortunately the effect\r\n  was an image of the World \r\n\r\nTrade Center amongst fire, not a pretty picture by\r\n  any standards.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-serif\">Whilst dealing with all these hiccups and \r\n\r\ndisasters, the band were also trying\r\n  to record their 6th studio album. Re-united with most of the IAW team, and\r\n  with MP and JP taking on the role of producers once more, the \r\n\r\nband set out\r\n  to create yet another epic masterpiece, and as was expected, they delivered!</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-serif\">Six Degrees of \r\n\r\nInner Turbulence, a 2CD semi-concept album, was release in\r\n  late January 2002 and received the best reaction from critics and fans of any\r\n  DT album before it. Comprised of 50 \r\n\r\nminutes of \'shorter\' songs and one 42 minute\r\n  marathon, SDOIT proved itself to be worthy of all its praise.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-\r\n\r\nserif\">Currently Dream Theater are in the process of touring the world once more,\r\n  and there is little sign of new releases from the members any time soon. There\r\n  is however a \r\n\r\nJohn Petrucci solo album in the works, and Chroma Key 3 is on\r\n  the way.</font></p>\r\n', '<img src=\"images/icon/icon-amp.png\">  Click <a href=\"images/rigs/petrucci.htm\" \r\n\r\nonclick=\"NewWindow (this.href,\'petrucci\',\'800\',\'600\',\'yes\');return false\">HERE</a> to view John Petrucci\'s guitars & rig.<br /><br />\r\n<br \r\n\r\n/>\r\n<strong>Guitars</strong>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Ernie Ball Music Man Signature Model (EBJPMM)</li>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<strong>Accessories</strong>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Jim Dunlop Jazz III \r\n\r\nPicks (Black)</li>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<strong>Amps and Effects list: (Updated 8.18.02)</strong>\r\n<br />\r\n  <li>3 - Mesa Boogie Mark II C+ heads </li>\r\n  <li> 1 - Fulltone \r\n\r\nFulldrive 2 overdrive </li>\r\n  <li>1 - Korg/Tone Works DTR-1 Digital Tuner </li>\r\n  <li>1 - Eventide DSP7000 Ultra harmonizer </li>\r\n  <li>1 - Crybaby DCR-15R rack wah (Dunlop) \r\n\r\n</li>\r\n  <li>1 - Furman PL-pro </li>\r\n  <li>1 - Digital Music Corp Dual Stereo line mixer </li>\r\n  <li>1 - Digital Music Corp GCX\r\n    guitar audio switcher </li>\r\n  <li>1 - \r\n\r\nMesa Boogie amp switcher </li>\r\n  <li>1 - DBX 166A Compressor/limiter </li>\r\n  <li>1 - T.C.

Much is not\r\nknown about this mysterious man\'s life. Many reports say that he is an android\r\nfrom \r\n\r\nanother planet, or even an alien. It is also said that he is half man/half\r\nchicken, being raised in a chicken coop by chickens. No one really knows. As\r\na kid growing up in the \r\n\r\nLA area, his mom gave him the nickname \"Boo\" because\r\nof his obsession with monsters and robots. At the age of ten he took karate lessons.\r\nHe shows off his skills with a martial \r\n\r\narts performances during concerts. By\r\nthe time he was 12, he was playing the guitar and a year later, he really started\r\nto get excited about it. His major influences are Angus \r\n\r\nYoung, Yngwie Malmsteen,\r\nand Randy Rhoads. He took guitar lessons for over a year from Paul Gilbert.\r\n<p>As a teenager, he was part of the notorious Deli Creeps. Even though \r\n\r\nthey\r\n  were from the LA area, they gained a following in the San Francisco Bay area.\r\n  With this popularity, Buckethead\'s amazing skills and unique style caught the\r\n  \r\n\r\nattention many people.</p>\r\n<p>In 1992, bassist/producer Bill Laswell and P-Funk legend Bootsy Collins learned\r\n  of Buckethead from Limbomaniacs drummer, Brain. The bandPraxis \r\n\r\nwas formed.\r\n  With Bill Laswell in as the producer, Buckethead, Bootsy, Bernie Worrell, Brain,\r\n  and AF Next Man Flip released the Praxis debut album, Transmutation. Later,\r\n  \r\n\r\nBuckethead went on the record many different projects and also five more Praxis\r\n  albums: Sacrifist, Metatron, Transmutation Live, Collection, and Warzsawa.\r\n  Like current \r\n\r\nbandmate Paul Tobias, Buckethead also auditioned for the Red Hot\r\n  Chili Peppers in the early 90s. Even though he didn\'t make it, they loved his\r\n  playing and said that he is \r\n\r\namazing, but his style was not right for the Chili\r\n  Peppers.</p>\r\n<p>In 1992, Buckethead released his debut solo album, Bucketheadland. In 1994,\r\n  he released two albums, \r\n\r\nGiant Robot, and one as Death Cube K (an anagram for\r\n  Buckethead) called, Dreamatorium. He used the alias Death Cube K so that he\r\n  could record another solo album with Strata \r\n\r\nwhile his contract was in dispute\r\n  with Sony. In 1996, he worked with the band Giant Robot and they eventually\r\n  released their self-titled debut. Also that year, he released \r\n\r\nanother solo\r\n  album, Day of the Robot. In 1997, another Death Cube K (Disembodied) album\r\n  was released. 1998 produced Colma, an album that seemed a bit \"softer\" than\r\n  his \r\n\r\nprevious recordings. 1999 brought us Monsters and Robots and another Death\r\n  Cube K album titled Tunnel.</p>\r\n<p>From the time he went solo, Buckethead has been involved in a \r\n\r\nnumber of various\r\n  projects. He participated in Giant Robot, Giant Robot 2, Zillatron, Cobra Strike,\r\n  Arcana, El Stew, Iggy Pop, George S. Clinton, and most notably, Primus \r\n\r\n(which\r\n  also included later GN\'R bandmate, Brain). At OzzFest \'99, he stunned the crowd\r\n  with his playing ability during Primus\' set. He was also featured on a couple\r\n  \r\n\r\nmovie soundtracks and scores such as Last Action Hero and Mortal Kombat. </p>\r\n<p>In an interview in 1989, Buckethead described his style as \"contemporary\r\n  fusion rock, played \r\n\r\nwith punch, verve and all the chops you could ask for.\" But\r\n  to try to describe Buckethead\'s style is complicated. Try to imagine a mix\r\n  of Paul Gilbert, Yngwie Malmsteen \r\n\r\nwith computer effects and sounds with a horror\r\n  soundtrack style. Add an amusement park attitude with styles and influences\r\n  such as hard rock/metal, funk, hip-hop, ambient, \r\n\r\nindustrial, a touch of country,\r\n  and a little of everything else. Now you will have a feel of what Buckethead\'s\r\n  style sounds like.</p>\r\n<p>Rumors about who the man behind \r\n\r\nthe bucket and mask really is are abundant.\r\n  Many people have said that he is Steve Vai or Paul Gilbert in disguise. The\r\n  man behind the bucket is not anyone that has ever \r\n\r\nbeen notoriously famous,\r\n  just a unique guy reportedly named Brian Carroll. In an interview in 1996,\r\n  Buckethead said that the reason for his strange attire is, \"I had \r\n\r\njust\r\n  seen Halloween IV\", he recalls of a dark night in 1989, \"and as soon\r\n  as it was over I went into a store across the street and said \'Do you have\r\n  any Michael Myers \r\n\r\nmasks?\' They had a white mask, which really wasn\'t like a\r\n  Michael Myers mask, but I liked it a lot. That night I was eating chicken out\r\n  of a bucket that my dad brought \r\n\r\nhome. It wasn\'t a Kentucky Fried Chicken bucket\r\n  either. It said \"Deli Chicken\" on the outside. I was eating it, and\r\n  I put the mask on and then the bucket on my head. I went \r\n\r\nto the mirror. I just\r\n  said \'Buckethead. That\'s Buckethead right there.\' It was just one of those\r\n  things. After that, I wanted to be that thing all the \r\n\r\ntime.\"</p>\r\n<p>Buckethead\'s influences cover a very wide range. Besides musical influences,\r\n  he is influenced from many things such as science fiction and horror movies,\r\n  \r\n\r\nartists, writers, and athletes, most notably Michael Jordan. He has a weird\r\n  obsession with Disneyland, which he has visited over 500 times. He hopes to\r\n  release an album in \r\n\r\nthe future comprised of Disney theme songs.</p>\r\n<p>Now currently residing in the San Francisco area, Buckethead is one of the\r\n  lead guitarists for Guns N\' Roses. The story \r\n\r\nstarted in December of 1999. Buckethead\r\n  was invited to a Christmas party at Axl Rose\'s house. At the party, Axl gave\r\n  him a Leatherface mask that he had been trying to find \r\n\r\nbut was unsuccessful.\r\n  This meant a great deal to Buckethead. Initially, he joined the band sometime\r\n  in 2000 and began to record tracks for the new album, Chinese Democracy. \r\n\r\nLater,\r\n  former Primus drummer, Brain, came into the GN\'R camp most likely from with\r\n  a reference from Buckethead. Buckethead adds new sounds to the old songs; he\r\n  \r\n\r\nimproves them superbly with his technical ability and wondrous imagination.\r\n  He adds a nice, clean touch to everything he plays. No one is sure how long\r\n  Buckethead will stay \r\n\r\nwith the band or whether or not he is a permanent member\r\n  or just there for the album and tour. Regardless of the conditions, he is doing\r\n  a great job.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n<p>He \r\n\r\ndraws inspiration from science-fiction and horror movies, musicians, artists,\r\n  writers, athletes and has bizarre fixation on Disneyland. His dream is to complete\r\n  his own \r\n\r\npark--Bucketheadland, \"Where all your dreams and nightmares can\r\n  come true.\" This theme runs through many of his recordings and was first\r\n  introduced to the public through his \r\n\r\nPsychobuddy columns in Guitar Player magazine\r\nback in 1991.</p>\r\n<p>Buckethead has cited Michael Jackson, Paul Gilbert, Shawn Lane, Yngwie Malmsteen,\r\n  Bootsy Collins and \r\n\r\nAngus Young (AC/DC) as major inspirations as well as the\r\n  experience of playing with Bill Laswell, Bernie Worrell, John Zorn, the Invisibl\r\n  Skratch Picklz and other artists he \r\n\r\nhas played and collaborated with. He also\r\n  finds inspiration in books, sci-fi/horror movies and athletes, most notably\r\n  Michael Jordan.</p>\r\n<p>Buckethead has cited lessons \r\n\r\nwith Paul Gilbert, classical guitar lessons,\r\n  Nicolas Slonimsky\'s book Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns, instructional\r\n  books and videos (by Steve Trovato, Danny \r\n\r\nGatton and Albert Lee), and the writings\r\n  and works of Glenn Gould as major points of his musical studies.</p>\r\n<p>Buckethead harnesses the spirits of all the slain and martyred \r\n\r\nchickens through\r\n  the chicken bucket on his head. Without it he is helpless.</p>\r\n<p>Buckethead has many special weapons and tactics for battling the monsters\r\n  and robots in \r\n\r\nBucketheadland.

Although both were \r\n\r\ntrained as classical\r\npianists, it was pop music that interested them most. Originally, it was Alex\r\nwho played guitar, and Eddie who played drums. But while Eddie was out \r\n\r\ndelivering\r\nnewspapers, Alex would practice on his drums, and soon he had superseded his\r\nbrother\'s ability. Not to be outdone, Eddie decided to switch to guitar. <br />\r\n<br \r\n\r\n/>\r\nAfter high school, the brothers played in various cover bands, and in the process,\r\nrented equipment from an Indiana native named David Lee Roth, who sang in a local\r\nband \r\n\r\ncalled the Red Ball Jets. As Eddie had never aspired to be a singer, he\r\nconvinced Roth to join his band, which they then dubbed Mammoth. One particular\r\ngig found the band \r\n\r\nsharing a bill with Snake, which led to a meeting and jam\r\nsession with Snake\'s bass player and singer, Michael Anthony. Impressed, the\r\nVan Halen brothers and Roth asked Anthony \r\n\r\nto join their band. In late 1975 or\r\nearly 1976, the group discovered that there was another band called Mammoth,\r\nand while several other names were suggested, the quartet \r\n\r\ndecided to use Eddie\r\nand Alex\'s last name, Van Halen.\r\n<p>From the start, Van Halen enjoyed the blessings of talent and luck. In 1976,\r\n  Gene Simmons of KISS caught the band \r\n\r\nplaying at a small club and offered to\r\n  produce demos for them (they had no record deal at the time). Soon after, Warner\r\n  Brothers\' house-producer Ted Templeman--who went on \r\n\r\nto oversee most of Van\r\n  Halen\'s albums--saw the band, and convinced label executive Mo Ostin to sign\r\n  them. </p>\r\n<p>Van Halen\'s self-titled first album endures as a \r\n\r\ntestament to the group\'s\r\n  vision, and set the standard for which a new generation of hard-rocking bands\r\n  would strive. Although the rhythm section was solid, it was the \r\n\r\ncombination\r\n  of David Lee Roth\'s flamboyant, sultry vocals and Eddie Van Halen\'s guitar\r\n  playing that gave the record its shape and vast appeal. Roth strutted as much\r\n  \r\n\r\nas he sang, his lyrics brimming with libido (\"Feel Your Love Tonight\"),\r\n  braggadocio (\"Atomic Punk\"), and mayhem (\"Running With the Devil\").\r\n  And the metal edge they gave to a \r\n\r\ncover of the Kinks\' \"You Really Got\r\n  Me,\" immediately distanced Van Halen from the sixties supergroups that\r\n  were still dominating rock radio. </p>\r\n<p>Eddie Van Halen \r\n\r\nbecame a role model for modern guitarists, regardless of their\r\n  tastes and preferences. His talent and skill were unquestioned, and he demonstrated\r\n  a dazzling array of \r\n\r\ntechniques, from simple riffs to extended solos filled\r\n  with intricate fret work. \"Eruption,\" an instrumental track on the\r\n  first album, became his calling card as it was \r\n\r\ntransformed into a lengthy showcase\r\n  during concerts. </p>\r\n<p>Van Halen II sounded subdued in comparison to the debut, but \"Dance the\r\n  Night Away\" and \"Beautiful Girls\" \r\n\r\nproved the band capable of\r\n  playing in a less insistent style. Women and Children First (1980) was somewhat\r\n  experimental, using keyboards and guitars to produce percussive \r\n\r\nsounds on \"And\r\n  the Cradle Will Rock.\" Their fourth release, Fair Warning (1981), was\r\n  another flourish. Vaguely prescient of urban decay and unrest, Van Halen--especially\r\n \r\n\r\n Eddie--played more urgently than on their previous two records. Roth, meanwhile,\r\n  continued to pen songs like \"\'Dirty Movies,\'\" tailor-made for Van\r\n  Halen\'s adolescent \r\n\r\nfollowing. Diver Down followed in 1982, and was a mixed\r\n  bag: five of its twelve songs were covers, ranging from Martha and the Vandellas\' \"Dancing\r\n  in the Street\" to the Roy \r\n\r\nRogers and Dale Evans standard \"Happy Trails.\" Controversy\r\n  ensued after the video for \"(Oh) Pretty Woman\" showed David Lee Roth\r\n  dressed as an ugly one. While Diver Down \r\n\r\nwasn\'t the band\'s best work, Van Halen\r\n  was as popular as ever, and headlined one day of the mammoth U.S. Festival\r\n  concerts in Southern California in 1983. </p>\r\n<p>1984, \r\n\r\nthe album, established Van Halen as the unquestioned leaders of a legion\r\n  of glam-metal acts. It was a return to form, and it found the band again toying\r\n  with its sound. \r\n\r\n\"Panama\" and \"I\'ll Wait\" are still rock-radio\r\n  staples, but \"Jump\" was the breakthrough, and Van Halen\'s first No.\r\n  1 single. With a catchy keyboard riff, a dizzying Eddie \r\n\r\nVan Halen solo, and\r\n  a lip-synched performance video, Van Halen left hard-rock stardom for the commercial\r\n  mainstream. </p>\r\n<p>In 1985, David Lee Roth released a solo EP, \r\n\r\nCrazy From the Heat. Buoyed by\r\n  the favorable reception to novelty covers of \"Just a Gigolo\" and \"California\r\n  Girls,\" he left Van Halen to pursue a solo career. Although Roth \r\n\r\ndrafted\r\n  some capable musicians to help him, notably guitarist Steve Vai, he quickly\r\n  discovered that he could not duplicate the creative or commercial prowess of\r\n  Van \r\n\r\nHalen. The decline of his solo career left him little more than a reference\r\n  point for rock-and-roll failure. </p>\r\n<p>The remaining trio of Van Halen considered numerous \r\n\r\nreplacements, and even\r\n  discussed the idea of a series of temporary singers. Eddie mentioned this to\r\n  the mechanic working on his Lamborghini, and was told that Sammy Hagar\'s \r\n\r\ncar\r\n  happened to be in the shop. Singer-rhythm guitarist Hagar was a veteran of\r\n  the band Montrose, and had just scored a solo hit with his testosterone-fueled\r\n  single \"I \r\n\r\nCan\'t Drive 55.\" Eddie called Hagar, and arranged for the\r\n  singer to meet the band. Soon after, Hagar officially replaced Roth. </p>\r\n<p>The \"new\" Van Halen released 5150 in \r\n\r\n1986. Three hit songs--\"Why\r\n  Can\'t This Be Love,\" \"Best of Both Worlds,\" and \"Love Walks\r\n  In\"--spurred the album, and it became Van Halen\'s first to top the Billboard\r\n  \r\n\r\ncharts. Hagar revitalized the band, contributing a fresh, radio-friendly sound\r\n  beyond his vocals. A pop feel also dominated OU812, released in 1988, and 1991\'s\r\n  For Unlawful \r\n\r\nCarnal Knowledge showed further refinement of Hagar-era Van Halen.\r\n  From the latter, \"Right Now\" was another ace: in addition to its\r\n  undeniably catchy chorus, it gained the \r\n\r\nband enormous MTV exposure thanks to\r\n  its smart, subtitled video. The song was subsequently used to promote the failed\r\n  clear cola Crystal Pepsi. Van Halen released a live \r\n\r\nalbum in 1993 that included\r\n  several covers and a couple of older songs, but primarily focused on Hagar\'s\r\n  years with the band. </p>\r\n<p>Balance (1995) rounded out Hagar\'s \r\n\r\ntenure, and just when it seemed that Van\r\n  Halen Version 2.0 would go on forever, something happened. A complex series\r\n  of events involving a possible reunion with David Lee \r\n\r\nRoth led to Hagar\'s departure\r\n  from the band. Hagar maintained that he was dismissed; Edward (no longer wishing\r\n  to be called Eddie) said that Hagar left. What is certain is \r\n\r\nthat Roth called\r\n  Edward Van Halen in the spring of 1996 to ask about his representation on a\r\n  greatest-hits package that was on the drawing board. The two visited, \r\n\r\nburying\r\n  any lingering resentment over their split, and Roth was brought back to sing\r\n  on two new songs for the best-of CD, \"Me Wise Magic\" and \"Can\'t\r\n  Get This Stuff No \r\n\r\nMore.\" He joined the band in New York for a non-performance\r\n  appearance at the MTV Video Awards in September of 1996, fueling rumors of\r\n  a complete reunion album and tour, à \r\n\r\nla KISS\'s successful return to\r\n  American arenas that same year. </p>\r\n<p>Roth later claimed that he wasn\'t responsible for fanning the fires. \"I\r\n  told Edward at that time \r\n\r\nthat I didn\'t think it was a good idea for the band\r\n  to go to New York half-cocked; and that I didn\'t want to imply by our presence\r\n  that we were \'back\' if in fact it was \r\n\r\njust a quickie for old time\'s sake,\" Roth\r\n  wrote in an open letter soon after. But even the insinuation that Roth was\r\n  driving a Van Halen reunion was enough to put him on \r\n\r\nthe outs again. Edward\r\n  Van Halen rebutted Roth vehemently in print, and just a few weeks later, Van\r\n  Halen drafted its third singer, Gary Cherone, formerly of the band \r\n\r\nExtreme.\r\n\r\n', '<li>Kramer Guitars</li>\r\n<li>Ernie Ball/Music Man Guitars</li>\r\n<li>Peavey Wolfgang Guitars</li>\r\n<li>Peavey 5150 Head</li>\r\n<li>Marshall 100W Super \r\n\r\nLead</li>\r\n<li>Evantide H3000 Intelligent Harmoniser</li>\r\n<li>2x Roland SDE 3000 Stereo Delays</li>\r\n<li>Lexicon PCM 70 Stereo Reverb</li>\r\n<li>MXR Phase 90</li>\r\n<li>BOSS \r\n\r\nSD1 Super Overdrive</li>\r\n<li>Dunlop Cry Baby Wah-Wah</li>\r\n<li>Boss OC2 Octave Divider</li>\r\n<li>T.C.

(11, '127.0.0.1', 'holdsworth-index.jpg', 'Allan', 'Holdsworth', 'Born: August 6, 1946<br />\r\n<br \r\n\r\n/>\r\nBands:\r\n<li>Tempest</li>\r\n<li>Gong</li>\r\n', 'Isotope', 'Norwegian Wood', 'Snow Moon', 'Guitarist Allan Holdsworth is widely considered to be one of the finest \r\n\r\ninstrumentalists\r\nin all of jazz fusion, yet has never truly received the recognition that he so\r\nrightfully deserves. Born on August 6, 1946, in Bradford, Yorkshire, \r\n\r\nHoldsworth\r\nwas originally taught music by his father, who was a pianist. First a saxophone\r\nplayer, Holdsworth didn\'t pick up the guitar until he was 17 years old, but \r\n\r\nlearned\r\nthe instrument quickly. After playing in local outfits (in addition to learning\r\nthe violin), Holdsworth relocated to London, where he was taken under the wing\r\nof \r\n\r\nsaxophonist Ray Warleigh. By 1972, Holdsworth had joined progressive rockers\r\nTempest, appearing on the group\'s self-titled debut a year later. U.S. drummer\r\nTony Williams \r\n\r\ndiscovered Holdsworth around this time, which led to an invite\r\nfor the up-and-coming guitarist to replace John McLaughlin in Williams\' Lifetime\r\nproject in 1975, as Holdsworth \r\n\r\nappeared on the Williams recordings Believe It\r\nand Million Dollar Legs. But Holdsworth\'s union with Williams was a brief one,\r\nas the guitarist joined up with French-English \r\n\r\nprog-rockers Gong (for such albums\r\nas 1976\'s Expresso and Gazeuse!, plus 1978\'s Expresso II), in addition to guesting\r\non recordings by Jean-Luc Ponty, Bill Bruford, Gordon \r\n\r\nBeck, Jack Bruce, UK, and\r\nSoft Machine.\r\n<p>Also in the late \'70s, Holdsworth launched a solo career, which over the years\r\n  has seen the release of 17 albums (a few \r\n\r\nstandouts include 1983\'s Road Games,\r\n  1985\'s Metal Fatigue, 1994\'s Hard Hat Area, and 2000\'s The Sixteen Men of Tain),\r\n  as the guitarist has been joined by such acclaimed \r\n\r\nmusicians as Paul Williams\r\n  (a former bandmate of Holdsworth\'s in Tempest), Gary Husband, Chad Wackerman,\r\n  Gary Husband, Jimmy Johnson, Steve Hunt, and Alan Pasqua, among \r\n\r\nothers. In\r\n  the mid-\'80s, Holdsworth was one of the first musicians to use a Synthaxe,\r\n  a guitar that contained a breath controller that proved to be a cross between\r\n  a \r\n\r\nsynthesizer, guitar, and saxophone (Holdsworth was awarded Best Guitar Synthesist\r\n  from 1989 through 1994 in Guitar Player Magazine\'s Readers\' Poll). In the \'90s,\r\nHoldsworth \r\n\r\ncreated his own signature guitar model with the Carvin company.</p>\r\n\r\nAllan Holdsworth is well known to contemporary musicians as an uncompromising\r\nvirtuoso who redefined and \r\n\r\nre-invented the voice and scope of the electric guitar.\r\nTo the mainstream of rock and jazz audiences, he remains a little known, unsung\r\nhero. To the initiated, Holdsworth looms \r\n\r\nas both musical legend and commercial\r\nenigma. In the early 70s, he began as a sideman to the protean forces who merged\r\nrock\'s electric instrumentation and driving pulse with \r\n\r\nthe improvisational mastery\r\nassociated with jazz. Holdsworth provided the searing, flamboyant edge that galvanized\r\nthat era\'s most celebrated recordings by the likes of Soft \r\n\r\nMachine, Tony William\'s\r\nNew Lifetime, and Jean-Luc Ponty. The sounds of Django Reinhardt, Charlie Christian,\r\nand later John Coltrane were among the primary inspirations that \r\n\r\nled Holdsworth\r\naway from his passion of bicycle racing, and into dance hall gigs, playing the\r\nMecca circuit in Northern England. Born in Bradford, in 1946, Holdsworth \r\n\r\nhad\r\nbeen tutored in many aspects of musical theory and jazz appreciation by his father,\r\nSam, an accomplished amateur musician.\r\n<p>With the 1990 release of Secrets (Restless), \r\n\r\nHoldsworth further revealed his\r\n  rich musical vision, where contemporary forms of music are crafted in an improvisational\r\n  context in defiance of conventional boundaries - a \r\n\r\nfull range of emotions and\r\n  textures. The Wardenclyffe Tower (Restless) opens a stunning new chapter in\r\n  a solo career that blossomed during the 80s. As a producer and \r\n\r\ncomposer, he\r\n  continues to explore an expanding galaxy of guitar-controlled synths with a\r\n  balance of his famed legato-lead stylings and an ever evolving array of chordal\r\n  \r\n\r\ncolorings. This 1992 album is stocked with further electric guitar innovations,\r\n  including two tracks featuring his newly designed family of mutant, baritone\r\n  guitars. \r\n\r\nWardenclyffe Tower, like Secrets features contributions from world-class\r\n  musical collaborators, including long-time bandmates like drummer Chad Wackerman\r\n  (Frank Zappa, Andy \r\n\r\nSummers, Men At Work) bassist Jimmy Johnson (Flimm and the\r\n  BBs, Dory Cayimi, etc.) drummer/keyboardist Gary Husband (Level 42), and keyboardist\r\n  Steve Hunt (Stanley Clarke) \r\n\r\nand drummer Vinnie Colaiuta (Sting, Tom Scott,\r\n  etc.). The sum of Holdsworth\'s production realizes an enchanting rhythmic and\r\n  harmonic chemistry - or alchemy - potent with \r\n\r\nunexpected melodic twists and\r\n  turns. The spontaneous, fiery dialogue of group live performance is framed\r\n  in Holdsworth\'s meticulous, state-of-the-art production techniques. \r\n\r\nThe Wardenclyffe\r\n  Tower, Holdsworth\'s seventh solo project, was dedicated to the technological\r\n  visionary and great inventor, Nikola Tesla; its title is taken from one of\r\n \r\n\r\n Tesla\'s greatest dreams. </p>\r\n<p>Many rock fans first became aware of Holdsworth\'s inventiveness when his musical\r\n  presence dominated two of the definitive &quot;progressive \r\n\r\nrock&quot; albums\r\n  of the late 70\'s, U.K., and Bill Bruford\'s One of A Kind. The successful 1978\r\n  debut release by U.K. was a band originally slated to be a reunion of \r\n\r\nKing\r\n  Crimson until Robert Fripp backed out of the project - Bruford suggested the\r\n  remaining trio try working with Holdsworth - known then as a promising English \r\n\r\n&quot;jazz/rock&quot; guitarist\r\n  due to his work with Tony Williams, Gong, and Jean-Luc Ponty. The personal\r\n  chemistry of U.K. soon proved too volatile to contain four musical \r\n\r\nleaders\r\n  in one group setting. Holdsworth and Bruford left the band, and continued their\r\n  earlier, more jazz oriented venture in Bruford, but Holdsworth still felt trapped\r\n \r\n\r\n in the confines of slick studio mega-productions. He longed for a more immediate,\r\n  live-oriented recording method, and the less rigid ensemble dynamics he found\r\n  so vital \r\n\r\nduring his work with Tony Williams. Like few guitarists before him,\r\n  Holdsworth realized a style, tone, and technique in a league of its own - one\r\n  he still strives to \r\n\r\nperfect. Many musicians who heard him never again looked\r\n  at the guitar in quite the same way. In the 80s, growing recognition followed\r\n  a series of successful solo recordings \r\n\r\nand extensive U.S. touring. An increasingly\r\n  supportive international audience embraced Holdsworth in Japan, and more recently\r\n  in Europe and Australia. He received a Grammy \r\n\r\nnomination in 1984, and later\r\n  won five consecutive awards from Guitar Player Magazine\'s readers\' Poll as &quot;Best\r\n  Guitar Synthesist&quot;, which inducted him into the \r\n\r\nGuitar Player Hall of\r\n  Fame. His fascination with the innovative guitar-like synthy controller, the\r\n  Synthaxe, began during the mid-80\'s, and soon found him eventually \r\n\r\nattaching\r\n  a breath controller to it - perhaps continuing a subconscious pursuit of the\r\n  instrument he was first attracted to - the saxophone. </p>\r\n<p>Today Holdsworth is \r\n\r\nwidely revered as a virtuoso stylist - and perhaps the\r\n  world\'s pre-eminent guitar synthesist. As for the legacy of his accelerated,\r\n  legato lead guitar phrasing, Guitar \r\n\r\nPlayer\'s editor, Tom Mulhern credited him\r\n  as that rare sort of guitarist who &quot;originated his own school&quot; of\r\n  guitar playing. By 1979, Holdsworth found his London-\r\n\r\nbased career at a standstill.\r\n  Just as rock\'s new wave found its way to the pop forefront by the onset of\r\n  the 80s, Holdsworth left Bruford, and immediately found difficulty \r\n\r\nin launching\r\n  a new rock project with friends rock legends Jack Bruce and John Hiseman. Bruce\r\n  would later appear as a guest on Holdsworth\'s 1984 solo release Road Games\r\n  \r\n\r\n(Warner Bros.), along with Bruford alumnus Jeff Berlin and drummer Chad Wackerman.\r\n  Holdsworth began his solo career after meeting Gary Husband - a brilliant musician,\r\n  and \r\n\r\neventually produced his first &quot;official&quot; solo project, I.O.U.,\r\n  with Gary Husband and Paul Carmichael. It was recorded in 1979 (re-released\r\n  on Restless), and \r\n\r\nindependently released two years later in the U.S. Having\r\n  nearly given up on music, friends prompted him to move to Southern California\r\n  where an eager and devoted core \r\n\r\nfollowing awaited him. Eddie Van Halen, who\r\n  had met Holdsworth when U.K. opened for Van Halen during a 1978 U.S. tour,\r\n  helped secure a contract with Warner Bros., but the \r\n\r\nrelationship with Warner\r\n  Bros. soured when record company executives dabbled with creative control during\r\n  the Road Games sessions. He soon struck up a partnership with the \r\n\r\nfledging\r\n  label Enigma (later bought out by Capitol), which later became, Restless. His\r\n  production work became more refined, through the course of Metal Fatigue, \r\n\r\nAtavachron,\r\n  Sand, Secrets, Wardenclyffe Tower, Hard Hat Area, None Too Soon, The 16 Men\r\n  of Tain, FLATtire and his latest All Night Wrong. </p>\r\n<p>Allan Holdsworth \r\n\r\ncontinues to tour in Japan, Europe, and the U.S. A review\r\n  by L.A. Times jazz critic Don Heckman raved about Holdsworth\'s touring band,\r\n  saying that Holdsworth was &quot;an \r\n\r\nunlikely guitar hero whose phrasing has\r\n  much in common with the expressions of saxophonist John Coltrane&quot;. Holdsworth\r\n  still pursues a daily passion as an avid cyclist \r\n\r\n(when touring and recording\r\n  permit) and currently resides in Southern California. <br>\r\n</p>\r\n', '<li>Carvin Signature Model</li>', 'www.therealallanholdsworth.com', 'Metal \r\n\r\nFatigue', 'www.therealallanholdsworth.com', ' June  1, 2002  @  7:30 PM', 1);

That same year, the \r\n\r\nBeatles had just emerged from Liverpool,\r\n  England, soon to make their mark on music history. But it would be another\r\n  twenty years before a lanky, tousel-haired Swede with \r\n\r\nhungry eyes would stand\r\n  the music world on its head once again. The intervening years before the day\r\n  in February 1983 when Yngwie J. Malmsteen stepped off the plane in Los \r\n\r\nAngeles\r\n  provided an environment ripe for the development of a musical prodigy. </p>\r\n<p>The marriage between Yngwie\'s army captain father and artistic free spirit\r\n  mother \r\n\r\nended in divorce not long after Yngwie was born. The youngest child\r\n  in a permissive household that included his mother Rigmor, sister Ann Louise,\r\n  and brother Bjorn, Yngwie \r\n\r\n(named, his mother claimed, for an old boyfriend)\r\n  was wild and unruly, and delighted in \"anything that had a lot of violence\r\n  in it.\" Music, especially guitar playing, was \r\n\r\nreserved for wimps, and\r\n  young Yngwie would have none of it. Early attempts at piano and trumpet lessons\r\n  failed to take hold, and the acoustic guitar his mother bought him at \r\n\r\nage 5\r\n  hung untouched on the wall. It wasn\'t until September 18, 1970, when Yngwie\r\n  saw a TV special on the death of guitar iconoclast Jimi Hendrix, that a flame\r\n  ignited \r\n\r\nin his mind. Seven-year-old Yngwie watched with awe as Hendrix blasted\r\n  the audience with torrents of feedback and sacrificed his guitar in flames.\r\n  The day Jimi Hendrix died, \r\n\r\nthe guitar-playing Yngwie was born.</p>\r\n<p>Applying his intense curiosity and tenacity to first an old Mosrite and then\r\n  a cheap Stratocaster, Yngwie immersed himself in the \r\n\r\nmusic of such bands as\r\n  Deep Purple and spent long hours unlocking the secrets of both the instrument\r\n  and the music. His admiration for Ritchie Blackmore\'s classically \r\n\r\ninfluenced\r\n  playing led him, through his sister\'s direction, back to the source: Bach,\r\n  Vivaldi, Beethoven, and Mozart. As Yngwie absorbed the classical structures\r\n  of \r\n\r\nthe masters, his prodigious style began to take shape. He continued playing\r\n  for hours each day, often falling asleep draped over his guitar.</p>\r\n<p>By age 10, he had taken his \r\n\r\nmother\'s maiden name of Malmsteen, focused all\r\n  his energies into music, and largely stopped going to school. At school he\r\n  was often branded a trouble-maker, getting into \r\n\r\nfrequent fights with people \"who\r\n  behaved stupidly,\" and excelling in the two classes that interested him,\r\n  English and Art. His mother, who recognized his unique musical \r\n\r\ngifts, allowed\r\n  him to stay home with his records and his guitar, where his mastery of the\r\n  instrument progressed unobstructed. The missing link, however, between the\r\n  \r\n\r\nformal structures of classical music and the flamboyant performance of Hendrix\r\n  was supplied by the music of another virtuoso, 19th century violinist Niccolo\r\n  Paganini. \r\n\r\nWatching Russian violinist Gideon Kremer perform Paganini\'s 24 Caprices\r\n  on television, Yngwie understood at last how to marry his love of classical\r\n  music with his \r\n\r\nburgeoning guitar skills and onstage charisma.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Yngwie\'s Trademark Style Begins to Emerge</strong></p>\r\n<p>By age 15, pulling off such antics as riding his \r\n\r\nmotorbike through the school\r\n  hallway, it was clear that school had no place for him, and he left for good.\r\n  He worked for a time as a luthier in a guitar repair shop, putting \r\n\r\nhis woodworking\r\n  skills to good use. It was here that he encountered a scalloped neck for the\r\n  first time when a 17th century lute came into the shop. The wood of the neck\r\n \r\n\r\n was carved out so that the peaks formed the frets. Intrigued, Yngwie scalloped\r\n  the neck of an old guitar in similar fashion and was impressed enough with\r\n  the results to try \r\n\r\nit on his better guitars. The scalloped fretboard was somewhat\r\n  more difficult to play than a normal neck, but his control over the strings\r\n  was so improved that Yngwie \r\n\r\nimmediately adopted it as a permanent alteration\r\n  to his equipment.</p>\r\n<p>About this time, Malmsteen began playing in a number of bands built around\r\n  his explosive guitar \r\n\r\nstyle, with long instrumental explorations that tried\r\n  both the ears and the patience of a Swedish listening public more used to the\r\n  pop anthems of ABBA. When he turned 18, \r\n\r\nthe army tried to recruit him as officer\r\n  material, based on his high intelligence test scores. Appearing possessed as\r\n  only Yngwie can do, he held a gun to his temple and \r\n\r\nvowed he\'d rather die than\r\n  serve in the military. Convinced, the recruiters sent him packing. Yngwie returned\r\n  to his music in earnest. In an early incarnation of Rising \r\n\r\nForce, Yngwie and\r\n  several friends recorded a demo set of three songs for Swedish CBS, but the\r\n  cuts were never released. Frustrated, Yngwie knew he would have to leave \r\n\r\nSweden\r\n  to get anywhere, and he began sending demo tapes to record companies and music\r\n  contacts abroad. One such tape found its way into the hands of Guitar Player\r\n  \r\n\r\ncontributor and Shrapnel Music founder Mike Varney. Yngwie was invited to Los\r\n  Angeles to join Shrapnel\'s new band Steeler--and the rest, as they say, is\r\n  \r\n\r\nhistory.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Yngwie Immigrates to America</strong></p>\r\n<p>Built around Ron Keel, Steeler\'s debut album proved to be a typical heavy\r\n  metal grinder memorable \r\n\r\nmainly for Yngwie\'s now-legendary unaccompanied solo\r\n  intro to \"Hot On Your Heels.\" By the time the album became a cult\r\n  favorite, Yngwie had already moved on to Alcatrazz, a \r\n\r\nRainbow-style band founded\r\n  by singer Graham Bonnett. Although Alcatrazz produced some of Yngwie\'s most\r\n  incendiary solo flights, including \"Kree Nakoorie,\" \"Jet to\r\n  \r\n\r\nJet,\" and \"Hiroshima, Mon Amour,\" it also proved to be too limiting,\r\n  and the only clear course was to go solo.</p>\r\n<p>Yngwie\'s first solo album, Rising Force (now considered \r\n\r\nthe bible for neoclassical\r\n  rock) made it to #60 on the Billboard charts, an impressive feat for a mostly\r\n  instrumental guitar album with no commercial airplay. The album also \r\n\r\ngained\r\n  Yngwie a Grammy nomination for best rock instrumental performance. Soon the\r\n  honors came rolling in: He was voted Best New Talent in several reader\'s polls,\r\n  Best \r\n\r\nRock Guitarist the year after, and Rising Force became Album of the Year.\r\n  Powered by the jaw-dropping guitar/ keyboard duals of Yngwie and longtime friend\r\n  Jens Johansson, \r\n\r\nthe band Rising Force blazed a trail on the concert circuit\r\n  that established Yngwie as one of rock guitar\'s brightest new stars and added\r\n  a new genre to the music lexicon: \r\n\r\nneoclassical rock.</p>\r\n<p>Yngwie\'s neo-classical compositions reached new heights in the 1986 album\r\n  Trilogy. To this day, it remains one of his favorites, both in lyrical \r\n\r\ncontent\r\n  and musical performance. At this point, Yngwie\'s influence on guitar technique\r\n  and composition was undeniable, although hoards of clones and Malmsteen wannabes\r\n  \r\n\r\ntried to copy his style without understanding his unique musical vision. Lacking\r\n  Yngwie\'s musicality, the clones merely sounded like proficient typists, ultimately\r\n  casting \r\n\r\na negative light on the neoclassical approach.</p>\r\n<p>In the following year, on June 22, 1987, just shy of his 24th birthday, Yngwie\r\n  wrapped his Jaguar around a tree, breaking \r\n\r\nthe steering wheel with his head.\r\n  The resulting concussion caused a blood clot in his brain that damaged the\r\n  nerves running to his right hand. After lying unconscious in a \r\n\r\ncoma for nearly\r\n  a week, Yngwie pulled through, only to find his picking hand totally useless.\r\n  Afraid that his career might be over, he painfully began therapy to bring \r\n\r\nthe\r\n  hand back to life, impatiently waiting for the damaged nerves to regenerate.\r\n  Not long out of danger himself, he learned that his mother, the main inspiration\r\n  of his \r\n\r\nlife, had died in Sweden of cancer. To further complicate things, financial\r\n  problems left him virtually penniless in the face of mounting medical bills.\r\n  Rather than \r\n\r\ncompletely giving up as many people would have done, Yngwie pulled\r\n  himself together and turned once again to music for his salvation.</p>\r\n<p>The result was Odyssey, not one of \r\n\r\nYngwie\'s favorites, but highly acclaimed\r\n  for its accessibility and broader audience appeal. The hit single and video, \"Heaven\r\n  Tonight,\" gave Yngwie his first taste of heavy \r\n\r\nrotation airplay and pushed\r\n  album sales just short of gold status in the U.S. With ex-Rainbow vocalist\r\n  Joe Lynn Turner as frontman, the Odyssey tour brought Yngwie in \r\n\r\ncontact with\r\n  a new audience not made up exclusively of aspiring guitarists. By February\r\n  1989, the show rolled into the Soviet Union for a groundbreaking series of\r\n  sold\r\n\r\n-out concerts in both Moscow and Leningrad (preceding Bon Jovi\'s Moscow\r\n  Peace Festival by nearly six months). After the final performance, which resulted\r\n  in the gold-\r\n\r\nselling home video Live in Leningrad / Trial By Fire, the band\r\n  members went their separate ways and the name Rising Force was retired for\r\n  good.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Yngwie \r\n\r\nMoves to Miami and Forms a New Band</strong></p>\r\n<p>Beginning a new phase of his career, Yngwie moved to Miami, Florida, and recruited\r\n  a new band consisting of fellow Swedes. \r\n\r\nAnchoring the lead vocalist slot was\r\n  ex-John Norum singer Goran Edman, whose versatile tenor adapted easily to Yngwie\'s\r\n  demanding melodies. Other positions were filled with \r\n\r\nmusicians who were not\r\n  well known outside Sweden but whose musical talents were exceptional: symphony\r\n  orchestra bassist Svante Henryson, experienced studio keyboardist and \r\n\r\narranger\r\n  Mats Olausson, and drummer Michael von Knorring. The new lineup\'s first album,\r\n  Eclipse, recorded and mixed at Miami\'s Criteria Studios, proved that Yngwie\r\n  \r\n\r\ncould write radio-ready accessible material without sacrificing his classical\r\n  style. Poor promotion by troubled record company Polygram stunted sales in\r\n  the U.S., but gold \r\n\r\nand platinum status in Japan and Europe vindicated Yngwie\'s\r\n  decision to leave Rising Force behind.</p>\r\n<p>In mounting frustration, Yngwie made the decision to leave Polygram \r\n\r\nin what\r\n  was to be a less than amicable parting. As Yngwie has often said, his life\r\n  always seems to be \"fire and ice, either really good or really bad with\r\n  no in-\r\n\r\nbetween.\" Once the negative situation with Polygram had been eliminated,\r\n  things began to look up. New manager Nigel Thomas was hard at work on Yngwie\'s\r\n  behalf, and by March \r\n\r\nof 1991 Yngwie had signed with Elektra Records. </p>\r\n<p>Yngwie\'s debut for Elektra, Fire & Ice, reached back to the noncommercial\r\n  perfection of his best compositions. The \r\n\r\nalbum burned with his personal emotions\r\n  while showcasing the classical structures of the Baroque composers who are\r\n  his heros. With this album, Yngwie was finally able to \r\n\r\naccomplish a lifelong\r\n  desire to record with an orchestra; this occurs in his arrangement of Bach\'s \"Badinerie\" from\r\n  Orchestral Suite No. 2, which is embedded in \"No Mercy,\" \r\n\r\nand in the\r\n  classical-inspired solo break for \"Cry No More.\" Critically acclaimed\r\n  for composition and performance, Fire & Ice debuted in Japan at #1 (\"Ichi-ban\")\r\n  and \r\n\r\nsold over 100,000 copies on the day of its release. The album reached gold\r\n  and platinum status across Europe and Asia. By June 1992, Yngwie returned to\r\n  Miami to rest and \r\n\r\neventually begin work on new compositions.</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, development of the new album was hampered by a devastating\r\n  series of events. Hurricane Andrew flattened much \r\n\r\nof Miami in August 1992,\r\n  then Nigel Thomas, Yngwie\'s manager for 4 years, died of a heart attack in\r\n  January, 1993, and in March Yngwie learned that Elektra had dropped him \r\n\r\nfrom\r\n  their roster. In July, 1993, Yngwie broke his right hand in a freak accident,\r\n  and in August he was the victim of a false arrest which made international\r\n  \r\n\r\nnews.</p>\r\n<p>In September, all charges against Yngwie were dropped, and by October his\r\n  hand had healed completely. A contract was signed with Japan\'s Pony Canyon\r\n  label, \r\n\r\nand serious recording got underway with new singer Michael Vescera (ex-Loudness),\r\n  drummer Mike Terrana (ex-Tony McAlpine), keyboardist Mats Olausson, and Yngwie\r\n  on bass. \r\n\r\nBarry Sparks from L.A. was later chosen as the tour bassist.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Yngwie Signs with Pony Canyon and Begins a New Phase of His Career</strong></p>\r\n<p>On Feb. 3 the new \r\n\r\nband lineup began rehearsals for the upcoming world tour.\r\n  The new album, The Seventh Sign, was released in Japan on Feb. 18, 1994. The\r\n  raw, aggressive power of the album \r\n\r\nbrought immediate comparison to one of his\r\n  earliest works, Marching Out. It quickly reached #1 on the International charts\r\n  and was certified triple platinum in Japan. CMC \r\n\r\nInternational Records picked\r\n  up the distribution rights for Europe and America, and worked vigorously to\r\n  promote the new album worldwide. Yngwie\'s 7th Sign tour played to \r\n\r\nsold out\r\n  audiences in Japan, followed by club appearances in Europe and the U.S. New\r\n  label CMC worked vigorously to rebuild Yngwie\'s core audience and get the new\r\n  \r\n\r\nalbum played on the airwaves. Although the U.S. still proved to be a difficult\r\n  market due to the current popularity of \"grunge\" music, The Seventh\r\n  Sign outsold all other \r\n\r\nYngwie albums in Japan and Asia.</p>\r\n<p>In September and October, Pony Canyon released two mini-albums, Power and\r\n  Glory (with Yngwie\'s theme for Japanese wrestling champion \r\n\r\nTakada) and I Can\'t\r\n  Wait (with two previously unreleased tracks and several live tracks from Yngwie\'s\r\n  concert at Tokyo\'s Budokan). A Japanese version of the Budokan show \r\n\r\nwas released\r\n  as a concert video, with worldwide distribution to be handled through CMC.\r\n  After nearly a year on the road, Yngwie ended the tour in November 1994, and\r\n  the \r\n\r\nband went home for a much needed break.</p>\r\n<p>In December 1994, construction began on Yngwie\'s own recording studio in Miami,\r\n  with state-of-the-art mixing board, tape \r\n\r\ndrives, and monitoring equipment.\r\n  Work also began on Yngwie\'s next album, Magnum Opus, with a target release\r\n  date of June, 1995, from Pony Canyon. Yngwie and his manager \r\n\r\nagreed to part\r\n  ways with CMC due to lack of distribution capability, and negotiations for\r\n  a new European/USA label deal began as soon as the master tapes were shipped\r\n  \r\n\r\nto Pony Canyon.</p>\r\n<p>The Magnum Opus tour got underway in September 1995 in Japan, covering an\r\n  unprecedented 17 cities and drawing his largest crowds ever. From there, \r\n\r\nthe\r\n  band headed to England and Europe for two months. Midway through the tour,\r\n  Michael Vescera developed bronchitis from a cold and had to drop out of the\r\n  tour for 5 \r\n\r\nshows. The concerts went on as scheduled, however, with Yngwie himself\r\n  stepping into the singer\'s role, although songs that were not in his range\r\n  had to be eliminated from \r\n\r\nthe playlist. Mike rejoined the band in Germany,\r\n  taking part in a festival minitour with 4 other bands, including metal veterans\r\n  Saxon. At year\'s end, Yngwie and the band \r\n\r\nflew home to the U.S. on Christmas\r\n  Eve, for a well-deserved rest.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Yngwie Records His First Album in Studio 308 </strong></p>\r\n<p>Beginning in January, Yngwie \r\n\r\nput his Studio 308 to good use, flying in several\r\n  old friends and musicians-- including Joe Lynn Turner, Jeff Scott Soto, David\r\n  Rosenthal, Marcel Jacob, and Mark Boals--to \r\n\r\nwork on a new project. For many\r\n  years, Yngwie kept in the back of his mind the desire to record some of the\r\n  songs he grew up with that influenced both the way he plays and \r\n\r\nthe way he\r\n  writes songs. Of course, that meant the music of Deep Purple, Rainbow, U.K.,\r\n  Kansas, Scorpions, Rush, and Jimi Hendrix. With old pals the Johansson brothers\r\n  \r\n\r\nproviding drum tracks and some of the keyboards, the \"Inspiration\" album\r\n  began to take shape. By mid-April, the tapes were mastered and cover artwork\r\n  was commissioned: a \r\n\r\npainting by Japanese artist Asari Yoda, featuring visual\r\n  elements representing the bands covered on the album. With the Magnum Opus\r\n  lineup disbanded and most of those \r\n\r\nplayers moving on to other projects, Yngwie\r\n  assembled a touring band that proved to be as tight and powerful as any he\'s\r\n  worked with: Mats Olausson continuing to anchor the \r\n\r\nkeyboards slot, Live in\r\n  Leningrad veteran Barry Dunaway on bass, Trilogy vocalist Mark Boals, and drummer\r\n  extraordinaire Tommy Aldridge of such bands as Ozzy, Whitesnake, \r\n\r\nand Pat Travers.\r\n  South America was the first site of attack for the new lineup, with crowds\r\n  of delirious Brazilians and Agentinians packing the large concert halls each\r\n  \r\n\r\nnight. The tour continued unabated into the U.S., Japan, and Europe, proving\r\n  that Yngwie\'s turbo-charged brand of melodic hard rock was not only NOT dead,\r\n  it had found new \r\n\r\nlife. </p>\r\n<p>Yngwie concluded the \"Inspiration\" tour in December \'96 with nearly\r\n  a dozen guitar clinics held in England and Europe. Fan response to these intimate\r\n  \r\n\r\nsessions with their hero was so positive that Yngwie promised to try to do\r\n  more such appearances in the future. After a brief stay in England, hanging\r\n  out with long-time \r\n\r\nfriend Uli Jon Roth, Yngwie returned home to Miami to begin\r\n  work on his next studio album as well as his much-anticipated work for electric\r\n  guitar and \r\n\r\norchestra.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Orchestral Work Fans Have Been Waiting for Becomes a Reality</strong></p>\r\n<p>After months of intensive work sequestered in his Miami Studio 308, \r\n\r\nYngwie\r\n  produced his first completely classical work, Concerto Suite for Electric Guitar\r\n  and Orchestra in Eb minor, Op. 1. In June of 1997, Yngwie flew to Prague for\r\n  a \r\n\r\ndate with the prestigious Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, which had recently\r\n  celebrated the 100th year since its founding. In three intensive days of recording,\r\n  with Atlanta \r\n\r\nSymphony conductor Yoel Levi wielding the baton, Yngwie\'s dream\r\n  to record a work of his own with a full symphony orchestra had become reality.\r\n  Anxious fans would have to \r\n\r\nwait until 1998 to hear the astonishing results,\r\n  but they didn\'t mind... many of them had been waiting for this since Yngwie\'s\r\n  debut album in 1984!</p>\r\n<p>Not one to \r\n\r\nrest on his triumphs, Yngwie returned to Miami to put the finishing\r\n  touches on his 1998 studio album, Facing the Animal, featuring none other than\r\n  Cozy Powell behind the \r\n\r\ndrums. Fueled with passion and a dark brooding intensity,\r\n  Facing the Animal was highly regarded by both critics and the majority of fans\r\n  as one of the Maestro\'s strongest \r\n\r\nofferings in years. Distributed outside Japan\r\n  on the Mercury label, Yngwie was able to get initial promotional support and\r\n  gave numerous press interviews for the album. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>Fatherhood and Other Life Changes</strong></p>\r\n<p>On March 6, 1998, one of the most momentous events in Yngwie\'s life occurred:\r\n  his first child, Antonio \r\n\r\nYngwie Johann Malmsteen, was born in Miami, Florida.\r\n  Yngwie and his wife April hardly had time to get used to their new role as\r\n  parents, however, because tour dates booked \r\n\r\nlong in advance now had to be honored.\r\n  So at age three weeks, tiny Antonio obtained his first passport! Luckily for\r\n  April and Yngwie, he turned out to be a real road dog \r\n\r\nlike his dad, and he\r\n  was happiest throughout the tour whenever they were moving in planes, trains,\r\n  buses, and taxis.</p>\r\n<p>However, while Yngwie was celebrating the \r\n\r\nbirth of his son, he also suddenly\r\n  had to cope with a tragic loss. Just as he was preparing to take the Facing\r\n  the Animal Tour on the road, a horrific nighttime car accident \r\n\r\nin England claimed\r\n  the life of Cozy Powell. Shaken, but determined to carry on, Yngwie hired Jonas\r\n  Ostman as tour drummer, and the crew set out for Japan, South America, \r\n\r\nand\r\n  selected dates in Europe and the U.K. During several sold-out shows in Brazil,\r\n  a new concert video and CD were recorded, called simply Yngwie Malmsteen LIVE!!\r\n  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately for fans, the U.S. and Canadian leg of the tour had to be scrapped\r\n  due to poor response from promoters and the loss of record company support,\r\n  because of the \r\n\r\nsale of Mercury/Polygram to Seagram/Universal. Thus, Yngwie\r\n  returned home to Miami with his family, and settled down for the rest of the\r\n  year, getting used to his new role \r\n\r\nas father.</p>\r\n<p>By early 1999, he had begun work on his next rock album, Alchemy. Released\r\n  in September 1999, this album gave many of Yngwie\'s hardcore fans something\r\n  \r\n\r\nthey\'d been hoping for: a return to his heaviest roots and themes. Of this\r\n  album, Yngwie said, \"I wanted to make an album where my playing was as\r\n  extreme as possible, with \r\n\r\nno thought to its commercial value. I wrote all the\r\n  lyrics, using topics that are most interesting to me, such as Leonardo da Vinci.\" Yngwie\r\n  explains, \"I chose this title \r\n\r\nbecause \'alchemy\' is where science and magic\r\n  meet - the science of the recording process meshed with the magic of the music.\" For\r\n  this return to the \"Rising Force\" sound \r\n\r\nand approach, Yngwie chose\r\n  Trilogy singer Mark Boals, who outdid himself on the demanding, often operatic\r\n  vocals Yngwie crafted for Alchemy. The album also featured the \r\n\r\nstunning graphic\r\n  design of Ioannis of Vivid Images, which departed from the usual \"photobook\" CD\r\n  liner design for a total design concept that incorporated a separately \r\n\r\nillustrated\r\n  panel for each song. Alchemy was heralded as Yngwie\'s \"guitar manifesto\" for\r\n  the new Millennium, once again blazing a trail for others to follow in a \r\n\r\n\"quantum\r\n  leap\" forward into the next phase of his career. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Goodbye Lewis Entertainment, Hello Spitfire</strong></p>\r\n<p>Early in the year 2000, Yngwie hired \r\n\r\nnew management, replacing Lewis Entertainment\r\n  which had not been able to advance his career satisfactorily in the USA. His\r\n  new manager, Miami businessman Michael Spitzer, \r\n\r\nbrokered Yngwie\'s contract\r\n  with Spitfire Records, which released Yngwie\'s album War to End All Wars in\r\n  November 2000, as well as his entire Japanese back catalog. Spitfire \r\n\r\nbacked\r\n  a media publicity blitz in the USA, resulting in Yngwie\'s best selling album\r\n  in the USA in years. </p>\r\n<p>Yngwie\'s life has been a continual series of ups and \r\n\r\ndowns, and the beginning\r\n  of the new Millennium was no exception. The successful launch of Yngwie on\r\n  a new, aggressive USA label got underway with a \"guest artist\" slot\r\n  \r\n\r\non label-mate Dio\'s Magica Tour. Following this highly visible month of touring,\r\n  Yngwie launched his own headlining ambitious 45-date American tour in March\r\n  2001. For the \r\n\r\nfirst month of the tour, rave reviews from fans poured into the\r\n  Fan Club and across the Internet. But this success was short-lived, when two\r\n  band members quit the band in \r\n\r\nmid-tour, leaving Yngwie with no way to continue\r\n  the tour and forcing the cancellation of over a dozen remaining USA dates. </p>\r\n<p>Fans were devastated, and the Internet \r\n\r\nbecame saturated with rumors of who\r\n  said and did whatever to ruin the tour. But with typical Malmsteen determination,\r\n  Yngwie put these setbacks behind him and immediately \r\n\r\nbegan auditioning new\r\n  band members to take on the overseas portion of his 2001 WAR tour, with the\r\n  hope of rescheduling the lost USA dates after his return from Japan. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>In addition to rock touring dates in Europe, Asia, UK, and South America,\r\n  the second half of 2001 also brought Yngwie his first opportunity to perform\r\n  his \r\n\r\ncritically acclaimed Concerto Suite for Electric Guitar , with the New\r\n  Japan Philharmonic Orchestra in Tokyo. The DVD/CD/VHS package of this groundbreaking\r\n  performance \r\n\r\nbecame Yngwie\'s first release of the year in January 2002, with\r\n  numerous offers to play the Concerto Suite for other orchestras around the\r\nworld.</p>\r\n<Br />\r\n<hr>\r\n<br \r\n\r\n/>\r\nThe master, the virtuoso, the man with the golden chops, the speed demon, the\r\nfretborad necromancer.....all these describe the one and only, Yngwie Malmsteen,\r\nguitarist \r\n\r\nextraordinaire. There are NO other guitarists as wonderful, and as\r\nbrilliant as him. The universally heralded neoclassical king, arrived on the\r\nscene 1983 to rescue the guitar \r\n\r\nworld from itself, mainly the stagnation caused\r\nby its emphasis on two hand tapping, and other fretboard trickery (heehee, that\'s\r\nhow Yngwie would put it, if he was telling the \r\n\r\nstory of his life, and all of\r\nhis fanatical fans would agree!!). His sweep picking and that vibrato to die\r\nfor, set him far apart from the rest, and still does. You may wonder, \r\n\r\nhow can\r\nsomeone that is supposed to be so great doesn\'t have a tribute album to honor\r\nand celebrate his name and music, its because no ojne can play good enough to\r\neven make \r\n\r\na suitable tribute to him! Yngwie created a guitar sound that was different,\r\nan ear-searing blend of metallic bombast and classical beauty. He elevated classical\r\nchops to new \r\n\r\nheights, adding a definite European stamp, both enchantingly dark-sounding\r\nand blindingly fast. From the moment I heard him I was immediately in love with\r\nhis style, there is \r\n\r\nnothing else quite like it.\r\n<p>In 1983 he came to the USA and immediately found a job as lead guitarist for\r\n  an underground band named Steeler (with vocalist Ron Keel, who \r\n\r\nlater formed\r\n  his own band, Keel, and then even later went *gasp* country. He has since returned\r\n  to the metal world). That is where it all began. Believe it or not, even \r\n\r\nat\r\n  the age of 20, Yngwie had already developed the guitar style that made him\r\n  famous in the guitar world. Steeler turned out to be quite boring for him,\r\n  since it was in \r\n\r\nmore of a band thing, and he was not even considered to help\r\n  with the music writing, and that was not what the guitar mastermind wanted.\r\n  Yngwie was next offered a spot in \r\n\r\nbands by both Phil Mogg and Graham Bonnet\r\n  (both strangely, have been vocalists in bands with Michael Schenker). Graham\'s\r\n  offer looked to be about the best, so Yngwie \r\n\r\neagerly joined Alcatrazz in hopes\r\n  of gaining even more exposure. After a quick writing session, they recorded\r\n  an album called \"No Parole From Rock and Roll,\" which contained \r\n\r\nfabulous\r\n  guitar work. The crystal clear notes and dark feel, were unique at the time,\r\n  and his speed and style was simply amazing. The guitar music, written by Yngwie,\r\n  \r\n\r\nwas taken to new heights, while the lyrics and vocals, by Bonnet, fell flat.\r\n  It was obvious that two worlds were colliding from the first opening note.\r\n  While Yngwie\'s \r\n\r\nguitar was other worldy, and gorgeous, the lyrics were stupid\r\n  and made little sense, and Bonnet\'s gothic caterwaul just did not sound right\r\n  on \"No Parole\". Yngwie did \r\n\r\nmanage to talk the egomaniac into allowing\r\n  him to put a small instrumental on the album. The result was a haunting song\r\n  called Incubus, and as far as Yng fans are concerned, \r\n\r\nwas the highlight of\r\n  the album. Graham soon tired of Malmsteen getting all the attention (after\r\n  all it was HIS band, and he had ditched Michael Schenker to front a band \r\n\r\nwhere\r\n  HE could get all the attention, and then this young, talented twerp shows up\r\n  and steals the show!). Yngwie was ready to leave anyway, Alcatrazz was too\r\n  \r\n\r\nrestricting, and conflicted with \"the vision\". Yng put together a\r\n  killer band, and recorded the ALL time classic album, \"Yngwie Malmsteen\'s\r\n  Rising Force\". Finally, the \r\n\r\nmaster was headed in the right direction!\r\n  An instrumental album, Rising Force, contains some of the best musical compostions\r\n  ever written. Such beauties as Icarus Dream \r\n\r\nSuite showcase his emotional, rather\r\n  gentle side, while others like Black Star are simply classics. The next year,\r\n  1985, it was time for a slight change. He brought in 18 \r\n\r\nyear old vocalist,\r\n  Jeff Scott Soto, who was (and still is) absolutely killer. His range is fantastic,\r\n  and well suited to what Yngwie wanted to create. Some considered this \r\n\r\nnew album, \"Marching\r\n  Out\" to be a failure, a step backwards for the guitarist. The guitar freaks\r\n  wanted Yng to continue with the all instrumental approach. But in \r\n\r\nreality,\r\n  it was the birth of a new beginning. The highlight of \"Marching Out\" was\r\n  I\'ll See The Light Tonight where Jeff Scott really shows what he can do. </p>\r\n<p>By \r\n\r\n1986, Jeff Scott Soto was out of the lineup, and Mark Boals was brought\r\n  in, another fantastic singer, but at this time, he was not quite as good as\r\n  Soto. That was alright \r\n\r\nthough, because the music that Yngwie created on this\r\n  effort, was so good, no one cared what Boals sounded like. My all time favorite\r\n  instrumental comes from this album, \r\n\r\nCrying. If there ever was a song that could\r\n  touch your heart and flood you with the saddest, most sorrowful emotions, this\r\n  would be it. The guitar truly is a link to this \r\n\r\nman\'s soul, and it shows on\r\n  this one. There is no finer acoustic guitar work than what is showcased here.\r\n  It is very gentle, very sweet, very sad. The transition from the \r\n\r\nacoustic to\r\n  the electric is absolutely fantastic, and when the crystal clear sound of the\r\n  electric kicks in, and the notes start flowing, a hand reaches out and squeezes\r\n \r\n\r\n your heart, it is the most soulful, the saddest sounding song I have ever heard.\r\n  You can practically feel the pain, the heartbreak. The first time I had the\r\n  priviledge to \r\n\r\nhear this wonderful song, I started to cry, it affected me that\r\n  much. Only the greatest musicians can take an instrument and create something\r\n  that can affect one in that \r\n\r\nway, and this proved that Yngwie could do it. Crying\r\n  was not the only good song on the album, the entire release was excellent,\r\n  and some say it was his most commercial \r\n\r\nsounding album, which is probably true,\r\n  and featured spectacular cover art, a painting of Yngwie fending off a triple\r\n  headed dragon with a Fender stratocaster. Other \r\n\r\nhighlights of \"Trilogy\" are\r\n  You Don\'t Remember, I\'ll Never Forget, Magic Mirror, and Fire. This album was\r\n  packed with themes of magic and mystery. Shortly after this \r\n\r\nrelease, Malmsteen\r\n  had a tragic car wreck which left the maestro in a coma for over a week, but\r\n  he managed to pull through only to realize that the damage that had been \r\n\r\ndone\r\n  to his hand had left it in very bad shape. He recovered quickly, and released\r\n  another album in 1988, which I believe is his best ever. </p>\r\n<p>Yngwie recruited \r\n\r\nvocalist extraordinaire, Joe Lynn Turner, to perform on \"Odyssey.\" Joe\r\n  Lynn also wrote all the lyrics for the 1988 effort, and the result was like\r\n  magic. The two \r\n\r\ncomplimented each other perfectly, and together they created\r\n  an album that outshines all others. The highlights were the ballads, Joe Lynn\r\n  has a gorgeous voice, he is the \r\n\r\nbest vocalist in the world, and he sounds magnificent\r\n  singing ballads. Yngwie\'s guitar rips your heart out, and Joe Lynn\'s vocals\r\n  tear it apart. When he sings Dreamin\' \r\n\r\n(Tell Me) it is so beautiful that it\r\n  still the heart. The lyrics only add to the sorrow with verses like \"dreaming\r\n  visions of you, feeling the love I never knew\" and another \r\n\r\nfavorite is \"here\r\n  we are on the crossroads of forever, shining star lights the way, walk with\r\n  me on the winds of time, love\'s mystery is for us to find.\" And the guitar\r\n \r\n\r\n music in this one blends with the music wonderfully. Its not too loud, it allows\r\n  Turner to really get to you with his soaring vocals, but its there, a sweet,\r\n  harp-like \r\n\r\nacoustic in the background, and then during the solo it switches\r\n  to a bubbling electric, that fits the mood of the song. Hold On is another\r\n  classic ballad from this album, \r\n\r\nand in some ways is even more heartbreaking\r\n  than Dreamin\'. The opening guitar riff is an attention grabber, and makes the\r\n  heart skip a beat when it starts up, its so \r\n\r\nbeautiful. Hold On has a bluesy\r\n  type feel to it, and the vocals are lush and beautiful, only Turner could perform\r\n  them like this. There are some rockers on\"Odyssey\" too, \r\n\r\nlike the\r\n  thundering Rising Force which has another great verse in it \"the lightning\r\n  strikes cracking the night, it feels like never before, thunder and sparks\r\n  in the \r\n\r\nHeart of the Dark, I hear a rising force.\" There is also an off-with-their-heads\r\n  gothic metal song, that leaves you missing the days when Ronnie James Dio would\r\n  sing songs \r\n\r\nabout witches,demons, dragons, and magic spells, in Rainbow, Sabbath,\r\n  and Dio. The song is called Riot In the Dungeons and is really killer, the\r\n  necromancer rips on this \r\n\r\none. Another album hot spot is Deja Vu. Overall, \"Odyssey\" was\r\n  wonderful, there was no way Yngwie could ever top this, especially since Turner\r\n  left to join Deep Purple, so \r\n\r\nYng was forced to find another singer. Swedish\r\n  born, Goran Edman came in to fill in the spot. </p>\r\n<p>Goran is really great, and his voice is very European sounding, which is \r\n\r\ndelightful.\r\n  They released two albums together, \"Eclipse\" and \"Fire and Ice\". \"Eclipse\" featured\r\n  another beautiful ballad Save Our Love which had yet another \r\n\r\nheartbreaking\r\n  guitar solo. Some may say that Yngwie\'s playing has no soul, no depth. They\r\n  say he is all speed, all technique, and that he does not play music that has\r\n  \r\n\r\nemotion. That is simply not true. A quick listen to I Am My Own Enemy on \"Fire\r\n  and Ice\" can prove that there is a direct link between his heart and the\r\n  guitar. \"Fire and \r\n\r\nIce\" was numero uno for Yngwie in the land of the\r\n  rising sun, debuting at number one on the Japanese charts, but its glorious\r\n  release was somewhat hampered by a string of \r\n\r\nevents that would all but devestate\r\n  our guitar hero. Hurricane Andrew flattened most of Miami, his tour manager\r\n  died of a heart attack, and shortly afterward Yngwie learned \r\n\r\nthat Elektra had\r\n  dropped him from their label. In July 1993 Yngwie broke his right hand in a\r\n  freak accident and was soon after the victim of a false arrest. After 1992\r\n\r\n\'s\r\n  classical sounding \"Fire and Ice\", which featured a mixture of guitar\r\n  and violins, Goran left to join Nikolo Kotzev\'s Brazen Abbot with ex members\r\n  of Europe and \r\n\r\nGlenn Hughes (who was later replaced by Joe Lynn Turner, who\r\n  Goran replaced in Yng\'s band). Yngwie then found another vocalist to take the\r\n  vocal spot. This time it was \r\n\r\nMichael Vescera, and he made a wise choice indeed. </p>\r\n<p>Michael is one of those vocalists, like those that came before him in Yngwie\'s\r\n  band, who can sing just about \r\n\r\nanything, but shines on the ballads. \"The\r\n  Seventh Sign\" was released in 1994 and was everything Yngwie fans hoped\r\n  and dreamed it would be. It was another well mixed album, \r\n\r\nwith great balance.\r\n  There were rockers like Crash and Burn, Hairtrigger, and I Don\'t Knowone of\r\n  the heaviest songs he has ever done, the crushing Pyramids of Cheops \r\n\r\nwhich\r\n  is like the Egyptian version of Rainbow\'s Stargazer. Also, this album did not\r\n  have one or two ballads, but three....Meant To Be, Forever One, and my favorite\r\n  \r\n\r\nfrom the album Prisoner of Your Love. My favorite verse from it,is the opening\r\n  of the song...\"my heart, fell into the palm of your hand, this love made\r\n  me understand, I have \r\n\r\nwaited all my life for you, thought I would live and\r\n  die alone, I\'m trapped, by your love.\" Bad Blood is also a killer, it\r\n  has a definite blues pattern to it, and the \r\n\r\nguitar proves that Yngwie only\r\n  improves as the years go by. Here it is dramatic and fast, wild and extreme.</p>\r\n<p>Yngwie continued on with Vescera for a duo of mini albums \r\n\r\nreleased only for\r\n  Japan, the first was made especially for a popular Japanese wrestler, who was\r\n  then the current champion called \"Power and the Glory\", and the second, \r\n\r\n\"I\r\n  Can\'t Wait\", was a mini album featuring two previously unreleased tracks\r\n  and some selected cuts from his concert gigs in Budokan. After a year of touring\r\n  the band \r\n\r\nwent back to the States where Yngwie started construction on his studio\r\n  which he named after the model of his favorite ferrari, 308.</p>\r\n<p>Vescera was also on the next \r\n\r\nrelease \"Magnum Opus.\" This disc, like\r\n  all of Malmsteen\'s releases, is fabulous and an instant classic. There is only\r\n  one true, slow ballad, I\'d Die Without You which is a \r\n\r\ngentle mixture of piano,\r\n  acoustic, and electric. The solo has to be heard to be believed. Tomorrow\'s\r\n  Gone has a doom like feel to it, and takes us back to the gothic days \r\n\r\nagain.\r\n  No Love Lost is one of those songs where you just have to attempt to sing along\r\n  even if you can\'t get as high up in range as Vescera, and anyone in the vicinity\r\n  \r\n\r\nthreatens to kill you if you don\'t stop with the howling. There is also Voodoo\r\n  which is a freaky sounding song that reminds me a little of some of Dio\'s weirder\r\n  stuff \r\n\r\n(like Don\'t Talk To Strangers). Of course, when it comes to Dio and Yngwie,\r\n  weird is good, if anyone else were to do stuff like that, I would say, \"that\r\n  sounds stupid, it \r\n\r\nmakes no sense,\" but the way Yngwie and Dio do it, it\r\n  does make sense, in a strange and twisted way.</p>\r\n<p> After \"Magnum Opus\" Vescera left to pursue his own musicial \r\n\r\ndreams\r\n  with the Michael Vescera Project, known as MVP, which Yng played guitar on\r\n  a few tracks. 1996 was a bit of a milestone for Yngwie, where he recorded his\r\n  first \r\n\r\nalbum in his new state of the art studio, a disc full of cover tunes\r\n  called \"Inspirations.\" Yngwie managed to breathe new life into classics\r\n  such as Gates of Babylon which \r\n\r\nJeff Scott Soto sang on, and completely blew\r\n  everyone away with his powerhouse vocals. Jeff also was killer on Mistreated\r\n  where he really did manage to sound JUST LIKE David \r\n\r\nCoverdale, who was the\r\n  vocalist on the original song with Deep Purple. Mark Boals also came on board\r\n  to sing a few songs, including In The Dead Of Night which was too good, \r\n\r\nand\r\n  the old Scorpions song, The Sails of Charon. Joe Lynn Turner showed up for\r\n  a few cuts too, Demon\'s Eye being the best of the bunch. Another great album\r\n  from the \r\n\r\nmaster axeman. </p>\r\n<p>Yngwie Malmsteen is truly superb, in 1997 he released yet another album, called\r\n  Facing the Animal which features Mats Leven of Abstract Algebra fame on \r\n\r\nvocals,\r\n  and the fantastic Cozy Powell on drums. It was released in Japan at first,\r\n  and then saw a major release in the United States, and featured some wonderful\r\n  tunes \r\n\r\nwith a slightly different slant on his guitar playing style. It was critically\r\n  acclaimed, and soon after his wife April gave birth to his first born son,\r\n  who they named \r\n\r\nAntonio, everything seemed rosy again for the man with the golden\r\n  chops. But just as soon as he was back on top of the world, a tragedy struck,\r\n  this time a car accident \r\n\r\nclaiming the life of his drummer, the legendary Cozy\r\n  Powell. Yngwie had also recorded an all instrumental masterpiece called \"Concerto\",\r\n  which delighted his fans all over \r\n\r\nthe world who wanted to hear him shine in\r\n  an orchestra setting. To satisfy the Japanese fans, Yng released a double live\r\n  album, called \"Live In Brazil\", and just when \r\n\r\neveryone thought the\r\n  Maestro was ready to settle down and become fully engulfed in familly life,\r\n  he then starts to work on another album, recruiting past \"Trilogy\" \r\n\r\nfavorite\r\n  Mark Boals. Together the duo created an aggressive masterpiece which became\r\n  a year end favorite with its almost power metal flavor. Such blistering cuts\r\n  as \r\n\r\nWield My Sword and Daemon Dance, not only satisified his current fanbase\r\n  but gained him even more into the legions of fans that adore him around the\r\n  world. </p>\r\n<p>The \r\n\r\nyear 2000 should be a big one for Yngwie. Two new \"best of\" albums\r\n  have been released to begin the year, starting with Pony Canyon\'s \"1994-1999\r\n  Anthology\", which features \r\n\r\ntracks from those selected years including\r\n  some unreleased masterial, while Dream Catcher\'s \"Best of Yngwie 1990\r\n  - 1999\" covers a larger time period as well as his ABBA \r\n\r\ncover \"Gimme\r\n  Gimme Gimme!\". He is already getting set to tour a little and attend & play\r\n  at several festivals all over the world during the summer, and he\'s also hard\r\n  \r\n\r\nat work on another album which may see release at the end of the year </p>\r\n<p>.... Yngwie is truly the greatest, and no matter what was said about his music,\r\n  he has continued \r\n\r\nfollowing his vision. And all of us who love him, are grateful,\r\n  that he has stuck to what he believed in and continued to compose the music\r\n  that comforts us, inspires us, \r\n\r\nand is our constant companion.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n', '<img src=\"images/icon/icon-amp.png\">  Click <a href=\"images/rigs/malmsteen.html\" onclick=\"NewWindow \r\n\r\n(this.href,\'malmsteen\',\'800\',\'600\',\'yes\');return false\">HERE</a> to view Yngwie Malmsteen\'s guitar rig.<br /><br />\r\n<li>\'72 Blonde Fender Stratocaster (The Duck)\r\n\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Fender Stratocaster Signature Model</li>', 'yngwie.org', 'Rising Force', 'yngwie.org', ' June  1, 2002  @  7:30 PM', 1);

(13, '192.168.2.8', 'satriani-index.jpg', 'Joe', 'Satriani', 'Born: July 15, 1956<br />\r\n', 'Summer Song', 'Crush of Love', 'Rasberry Jam', 'Storming onto the \r\n\r\nmusic scene nearly a decade ago, Joe Satriani has been widely\r\nrecognized as the archetypal post-modern hero.\r\n<p>Since his emergence in 1986 with a self-released, self-titled \r\n\r\ndebut album,\r\n  Joe has become the most recognizable guitar voice of his time, earning his\r\n  place alongside the great masters of rock guitar. As an instrumental artist\r\n  in a \r\n\r\npop-dominated field, Satriani\'s accomplishments are even more remarkable:\r\n  He is perhaps the most successful rock instrumentalist in recent history, selling\r\n  millions of \r\n\r\nrecords and consistently packing concert halls - yet always preserving\r\n  a strong musical vision, as well as the respect of fellow musicians and forward-thinking\r\n  music fans \r\n\r\nworldwide. </p>\r\n<p>Satriani\'s gift is creating highly evolved instrumental music, using the structure\r\n  of popular standard songs that allows listeners to latch onto tuneful \r\n\r\nmelodies\r\n  before being dazzled by his acclaimed musicianship. His hallmarks are a warm,\r\n  bluesy tone and delicate phrasing, combined with the bursts of superhuman \r\n\r\ntechnical\r\n  facility which upped the ante well beyond the standards set by generations\r\n  of great rock musicians before him. </p>\r\n<p>Crystal Planet teams Satriani with \r\n\r\nbassist Stuart Hamm and drummer Jeff Campitelli,\r\n  two longtime collaborators who lend rich support to the album\'s striking variety\r\n  of tunes. Satriani unleashes his heralded \r\n\r\nsounds and techniques throughout\r\n  the album, reaching apocalyptic extremes on the title track and \"Time.\" Typically,\r\n  his soloing never disappoints, and on such new pieces as \r\n\r\n\"Trundumbalind\" and \"With\r\n  Jupiter in Mind,\" he hits new heights of stun-guitar artistry. Tunes like\r\n  the moody \"A Piece of Liquid\" conjure cooler, more subdued \r\n\r\natmospheres\r\n  which balance the record\'s intensity. </p>\r\n<p>Elsewhere on the album, Satriani revisits the familiar sound that demanded\r\n  the attention of millions of pop \r\n\r\nfans: \"A Train of Angles\" creates\r\n  the joyous pop mood heard in such classic Satriani radio hits as \"Summer\r\n  Song.\" On new tunes like \"Raspberry Jam Delta-V,\" the melodies\r\n \r\n\r\n escalate into passages so stunning, it\'s difficult to believe they were performed\r\n  with just two hands on a single instrument. </p>\r\n<p>Joe Satriani was born in Westbury, New \r\n\r\nYork, and began playing guitar at age\r\n  14. By 1971, he was teaching guitar to others, one of his students being Steve\r\n  Vai. In 1974, Joe studied with two modern jazz masters, \r\n\r\nguitarist Billy Bauer\r\n  and pianist/composer Lennie Tristano; four years later, he moved to Berkeley,\r\n  California, where he began a 10-year guitar teaching career with students \r\n\r\nincluding\r\n  David Bryson (Counting Crows), Kirk Hammett (Metallica), Larry LaLonde (Primus),\r\n  and Charlie Hunter, among others. In 1984, Joe released a self-titled five-\r\n\r\nsong\r\n  EP on his own Rubina label, and the following year completed his first full-length\r\n  album Not Of This Earth, which was financed on a credit card and released in\r\n  \r\n\r\n1986 on Relativity Records. </p>\r\n<p>In October 1987, Relativity released Satriani\'s second album Surfing With\r\n  The Alien. The record became a global phenomenon, going platinum \r\n\r\nwith sales\r\n  of over a million copies in the U.S. alone and landing Satriani\'s face on the\r\n  covers of such magazines as Guitar Player, Musician, Guitar World, and dozens\r\n  \r\n\r\nof other international publications. Surfing With The Alien was a landmark\r\n  release which showcased the guitarist\'s stunning array of composing, playing\r\n  , and producing \r\n\r\ntalents. Consequently and deservedly, it became the most successful\r\n  instrumental rock record since Jeff Beck\'s Wired. </p>\r\n<p>Each subsequent Satriani release - including \r\n\r\nFlying In A Blue Dream, The Extremist,\r\n  Time Machine and the recent Joe Satriani, which was produced by the legendary\r\n  Glyn Johns - has drawn great commercial and critical \r\n\r\nattention. The same seems\r\n  certain to be the case with Crystal Planet, and it\'s not just Joe\'s fans who\r\n  have been moved by his unique tone and feel: Players from all walks \r\n\r\nof musical\r\n  life have been attracted to Satriani\'s work. </p>\r\n<p>After sitting in with Joe\'s band at New York\'s Bottom Line, Mick Jagger recruited\r\n  Joe in 1988 as lead \r\n\r\nguitarist for the singer\'s very first tour apart from the\r\n  Rolling Stones. Deep Purple tapped into Satriani\'s mastery when he assumed\r\n  lead guitar position in the band for \r\n\r\nits 1994 tours of Europe and Japan. In\r\n  1996, the G3 Tour - featuring Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, and Eric Johnson - played\r\n  24 dates to some 90,000 fans across North America, a \r\n\r\ntour documented on the\r\n  G3 Live In Concert album and home video (both Epic). In 1997, Joe united with\r\n  jazz guitar great Pat Martino to record two tracks, \"Ellipsis\" and \r\n\r\n\"Never\r\n  and After,\" for Martino\'s acclaimed all-star collection All Sides Now\r\n  (Blue Note); and enlisted in a second G3 summer tour, this one co-starring\r\n  Steve Vai, \r\n\r\nKenny Wayne Shepherd, and Robert Fripp. </p>\r\n<p>With its cunning marriage of well-structured songs, challenging sonic surprises,\r\n  moody moments and breathtaking guitar playing, \r\n\r\nCrystal Planet has all the marks\r\n  of a great Joe Satriani disc. After a decade of ground breaking work, this\r\n  is one musician still willing to push the edge of conventional \r\n\r\nrock beyond\r\n  what\'s come before. <br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><hr><br />\r\n<p><strong><font size=\"4\">Joe Satriani\'s Chronology</font></strong><br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  July 15, 1956 \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n  Born in Westbury New York </p>\r\n<p>1970 <br>\r\n  First picks up the Guitar\r\n</p>\r\n<p>  1971 <br>\r\n  Teaches guitar for next three years at home in Westbury, Long \r\n\r\nIsland (NY).\r\nSteve Vai is one of his first students. </p>\r\n<p>September 1972 <br>\r\n  High School Music teacher Bill Wescott introduces Joe to pitch axis theory. </p>\r\n<p>1974 \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n  Self taught for the last four years, Joe takes lessons for three weeks with\r\n    Billy Bauer in Glen Cove, NY.

Still it is a term held very close to the heart for schooled\r\nand unschooled music \r\n\r\nlovers alike, regarded as too great an honor to bestow upon\r\nanyone less than the highest order. In the world of rock music, a genre still\r\nonly 50 years old, virtuoso are few and \r\n\r\nfar between. Jimi Hendrix may have been\r\nthe first, paving the way for the likes of Edward Van Halen and Michael Hedges,\r\nmusicians whose vision and unfiltered expression on their \r\n\r\ninstruments did not\r\nhearken to their musical ancestry but instead cleared a new musical path and\r\nin doing so, changed the way we understand music. Steve Vai is part of that \r\n\r\ntradition,\r\none of few generally accepted as true virtuosi in an age when there are more\r\nincredible musicians alive and making music than ever before. With a \r\n\r\nprofessional\r\nmusical career that is stunning in its diversity and history, Vai is a unique\r\nand interesting character who refuses to stop growing, unable to be confined\r\nto one \r\n\r\nstyle or stereotype. Because like most other virtuosi, he doesn\'t know\r\nhow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven Siro Vai was born June 6, 1960 at Nassau County Hospital in New York,\r\nthe \r\n\r\nfourth of five children born to John and Theresa Vai. Growing up in Carle\r\nPlace (Long Island, NY) and influenced at an early age by his sister\'s love of\r\nmusic, Steve started \r\n\r\nplaying organ at age 6 (the first melody he ever played\r\nwas the theme from the Bette Davis movie \"Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte\"),\r\nand at 10 years old started playing accordion. \"I \r\n\r\nnever got into music,\r\nI was just always into music from as early as I can remember\", Steve recalls,\r\nrecounting \"Yogi Bear & Friends\", \"The Partridge Family Picture\r\nAlbum\", \r\n\r\nFrank Zappa\'s \"Freak Out!\" and Deep Purple\'s \"Machinehead\" as\r\nthe albums that were most important to him at that age. When Steve was about\r\n13 years old however, he picked up a \r\n\r\nguitar, and he hasn\'t been quite the same\r\nsince.\r\n<p>Knowing that he wanted to play guitar like Jimmy Page but not knowing how,\r\n  Steve turned to local guitar hero Joe \r\n\r\nSatriani. Satriani was also young, only\r\n  four years older than Steve, but he already had a local reputation as a great\r\n  guitarist and Steve started taking guitar lessons from \r\n\r\nJoe at $5 each. In the\r\n  beginning, in fact, Steve and another friend both took lessons from Joe at\r\n  the same time so they could better afford it at $2.50 each. Steve \r\n\r\ncontinued\r\n  to take lessons from Joe for about three years, and Joe Satriani was an undeniably\r\n  massive influence on a young Steve Vai in the mid 70\'s. Steve played with \r\n\r\nseveral\r\n  different bands during these years, including performances at Carle Place High\r\n  School and with his bands Circus and Rayge, and also teaching guitar to students\r\n  \r\n\r\nof his own. In 1978 Steve packed up and left Long Island for Boston\'s Berklee\r\n  School Of Music, where he would form the bands Morning Thunder with Randy Coven\r\n  and Axis Bold \r\n\r\nAs Love with Stu Hamm, meet his future wife Pia Maiocco, and\r\n  record a demo cassette for one Mr Frank Zappa.</p>\r\n<p>The Zappa demo included Steve\'s recordings of Zappa\'s \"The \r\n\r\nBlack Page\r\n  No. 1\", a ferociously difficult piece of music played at regular tempo,\r\n  and then played again at nearly twice the speed. Vai\'s transcriptionist talents\r\n  were \r\n\r\nalso obvious to Frank, and an invitation to try out for Frank\'s band was\r\n  extended. Steve moved to Los Angeles the next year and at 19 years of age became\r\n  the youngest \r\n\r\nmusician ever to join the Zappa ranks.</p>\r\n<p>Steve toured and recorded with Frank Zappa from 1980 through 1983, and achieved\r\n  a number of milestones while with Zappa. In \r\n\r\nOctober 1981, Zappa\'s Halloween\r\n  show from New York\'s Palladium was the first live music video to be aired on\r\n  television, and in 1982 the band was the first rock band to \r\n\r\never play in Sicily.\r\n  They were also the last.</p>\r\n<p>Leaving Zappa\'s band in 1983, Steve soon recorded his first two solo albums,\r\n  the LP \"Flex-Able\" and \"Flex-Able \r\n\r\nLeftovers\", a 10\" record\r\n  of material that didn\'t make it on \"Flex-Able\" which was released\r\n  in extremely limited quantities (1000). Both records were a testament to \r\n\r\nSteve\'s\r\n  artistic playfulness, with three different covers being designed for \"Flex-Able\" and\r\n  two for \"Flex-Able Leftovers\". While both albums enjoyed popularity\r\n  among \r\n\r\nZappa fans and Steve\'s growing fan base, it was one track in particular\r\n  from \"Flex-Able\" called \'The Attitude Song\' that helped catapult\r\n  Steve Vai into the guitar \r\n\r\nworld.</p>\r\n<p>\'The Attitude Song\' was released as a 7\" flexi-disc soundpage in a 1985\r\n  issue of Guitar Player magazine and nothing would ever be the same again. The\r\n  \r\n\r\nguitar community was up in arms about this new kid in LA whose chops were unlike\r\n  anything they had heard, and it was that song which landed Steve his role in\r\n  the movie \r\n\r\n\"Crossroads\". Local LA club shows started selling out quickly,\r\n  and soon Steve was enlisted to replace Yngwie Malmsteen in the band Alcatrazz.\r\n  Steve would record all of the \r\n\r\nguitars on the \"Disturbing The Peace\" album\r\n  in 1985, and the following tour would spawn a home video called \"Power\r\n  Live\". The 80\'s spawned a number of other albums with \r\n\r\nSteve Vai on guitar\r\n  as well.</p>\r\n<p>Soon after the Alcatrazz tour, Steve joined with David Lee Roth to record\r\n  the 1986 Warner Bros multiplatinum record \"Eat \'Em & \r\n\r\nSmile\",\r\n  and so began one of the biggest chapters yet in the story of Steve Vai. The\r\n  timing could not have been better and his alliance with Roth threw Vai into\r\n  the \r\n\r\nglobal spotlight like never before. Music videos for \'Yankee Rose\' and\r\n  \'Going Crazy!\' were in heavy rotation on MTV and music channels all over the\r\n  world, and Steve \r\n\r\nfound himself on the cover of countless music magazines. It\r\n  was during this time that designed and developed a line of guitars with Ibanez,\r\n  called Jem guitars, which were \r\n\r\ninstantly popular and continue to sell very\r\n  well worldwide. His partnership with Roth would include another multiplatinum\r\n  album \"Skyscraper\" and its following worldwide tour \r\n\r\n(as well as several\r\n  more videos, Top 20 singles, and magazine covers) before Steve finally left\r\n  in December 1988 to marry his longtime love Pia, and pursue a solo \r\n\r\ncareer.</p>\r\n<p>What came next was as much a surprise to Steve Vai as anyone else. While preparing\r\n  to record his long awaited solo album, Steve was asked to join the rock \r\n\r\nband\r\n  Whitesnake. Though Steve wanted to concentrate on his own album first and foremost,\r\n  the Whitesnake situation was too good to pass up. Steve joined the band, \r\n\r\nrecorded\r\n  all of the guitars on \"Slip Of The Tongue\" (Whitesnake\'s guitarist\r\n  Adrian Vandenberg could not record due to injuries), did a successful world\r\n  tour, and cross \r\n\r\npromoted his solo album, the epic \"Passion And Warfare\".</p>\r\n<p>\"Passion And Warfare\" is considered by many to be Vai\'s finest work\r\n  and one of the greatest instrumental \r\n\r\nguitar albums of all time. Recorded immediately\r\n  after the Whitesnake recording but before the Whitesnake tour, it was an album\r\n  many years in the making and is an incredibly \r\n\r\ndiverse and colorful work, utilizing\r\n  7-string electric guitars (designed by Steve with Ibanez, these guitars were\r\n  instantly popular and Steve is considered by many to be \r\n\r\nresponsible for the\r\n  advent of the 7-string guitar). With its rich musical tapestries and exploratory\r\n  studio experimentation, it was a favorite of fans and critics alike, and \r\n\r\ngenerated\r\n  three videos, \'The Audience Is Listening\', \'I Would Love To\', and \'For The\r\n  Love Of God\'. The album received a Grammy nomination and netted countless \r\n\r\nawards\r\n  from various music magazines.</p>\r\n<p>It was also during this period, on March 1 1990, that Steve & Pia Vai\r\n  had their first child, a son named Julian Angel Vai. \r\n\r\nLater in 1991, Steve Vai\r\n  would participate in the \"Zappa\'s Universe\" tribute performances\r\n  in New York, bringing Steve a Grammy Award for \"Sofa\".</p>\r\n<p>In 1991, after \r\n\r\nleaving Whitesnake, Steve put on his Producer hat for the band\r\n  Bad4Good, featuring young guitar prodigy Thomas McRocklin. The Bad4Good album \"Refugee\" was\r\n  released in 1992. \r\n\r\nOn March 1 1993 Steve & Pia had their second son, Fire\r\n  Vai, born on the same day that his brother Julian was born three years prior.\r\n  Soon after that, Steve went to work on \r\n\r\nhis new project tentatively titled Light\r\n  Without Heat.</p>\r\n<p>Light Without Heat eventually became VAI, an incredible ensemble featuring\r\n  Steve on guitar, Devin Townsend \r\n\r\non vocals, TM Stevens on bass and Terry Bozzio\r\n  on drums. The album, \"Sex & Religion\", took everyone by surprise.\r\n  When everybody expected a safe & bankable sequel to \"Passion \r\n\r\nAnd Warfare\",\r\n  Vai took a sharp left turn and did the completely unexpected. It was a savage\r\n  and unrestrained record that blended explosive aggression with beautifully\r\n  \r\n\r\nmoving instrumentals, and which was met with mixed reviews. It is the \"sleeper\" Vai\r\n  album, one that long time fans are still coming around to, and many fans consider\r\n  it \r\n\r\ntheir favorite. A world tour followed, starting in September 1993 and ending\r\n  in January 1994.</p>\r\n<p>1995 was another busy year for Vai. Intensive work was underway on a new \r\n\r\nalbum\r\n  tentatively titled \"Fire Coma\", and it was turning into a massive\r\n  undertaking. To tide over his fans for a while as he finished the album, he\r\n  quickly wrote, \r\n\r\nrecorded and released a 34-minute EP called \"Alien Love\r\n  Secrets\". It met with great reviews, was nominated for a Grammy Award,\r\n  and Bon Jovi asked Vai to open for them on \r\n\r\ntheir 1995 US summer tour. Amidst\r\n  much press and the touring, Steve continued to work diligently on the \"Fire\r\n  Coma\" project (which was released in 1996, called \"Fire \r\n\r\nGarden\",\r\n  but more on that later).</p>\r\n<p>1996 was another huge year. Steve played with Chick Corea on RCA\'s \"Songs\r\n  Of West Side Story\" CD, which was a dream realized, as \r\n\r\nSteve listened\r\n  to the original soundtrack endlessly while growing up. The Hendrix album Steve\r\n  plays on, \"In From The Storm\", gained popularity worldwide, and a\r\n  Steve \r\n\r\nVai signature model wah-wah pedal was developed by Morley. The biggest\r\n  happenings of \'96, however, were certainly the release of Vai\'s long-awaited \"Fire\r\n  Garden\", a 74-\r\n\r\nminute collection of music that marked Steve\'s real debut\r\n  as a vocalist, and Vai\'s involvement in the G3 concert tours featuring Joe\r\n  Satriani, Eric Johnson & Steve Vai. \r\n\r\nThe G3 tours brought the three guitarists\r\n  to sold-out venues nationwide, and produced a live CD & video (three songs\r\n  of which, including Steve Vai\'s \"For The Love Of God\", \r\n\r\nwere nominated\r\n  for Grammy Awards).</p>\r\n<p>With 4 Grammy nominations and 1 Grammy Award under his belt and millions and\r\n  millions of records sold worldwide, Steve Vai shows \r\n\r\nno signs of slowing down.\r\n  To the contrary, he is busier than ever working on a number of projects more\r\n  diverse and exciting than anything he\'s done yet. Stay tuned and hold \r\n\r\non tight.\r\n  It\'s been a very interesting ride so far, and we\'re not even halfway done. <br>\r\n</p>\r\n', '<li>Ibanez JEM Signature Model</li>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<IMG \r\n\r\nSRC=\"images/rigs/vai_files/vai.jpg\" WIDTH=\"368\" HEIGHT=\"225\" BORDER=\"0\" ALT=\"Steve Vai JEM7VWH Signature Model\">', 'www.vai.com', 'The Audience Is Listening', 'Unknown', ' June  1, \r\n\r\n2002  @  7:30 PM', 2),

After the sale of over 60,000 records on 206, the \r\n\r\nmajor labels were falling\r\nover themselves to sign the band.

They also made live \r\n\r\ntelevision appearances on the\r\n  American Music Awards and the 1991 MTV Video awards show where they were presented\r\n  with the Viewers Choice Award. IN the fall of 1991, the band \r\n\r\nreleased Operation:\r\n  Livecrime, an in-concert audio/visual recording of heir now legendary rock\r\n  opera.</p>\r\n<p>In 1992 Queensrÿche was nominated for another Grammy and the \r\n\r\nband had\r\n  the honor of playing live at the Grammy Awards show in New York City.</p>\r\n<p>After two years of touring the band took a much needed break and in 1994 returned\r\n  \r\n\r\nwith Promised Land. Recorded by James Barton and the band in a cabin in a remote\r\n  island in the Pacific Northwest, Promised Land was an introspective examination\r\n  of the self. \r\n\r\nWith the hits “I Am I,” “Bridge” and “Dis\r\n  con nec ted,” the record debuted at Number Three on the Billboard chart\r\n  and achieved platinum certification.</p>\r\n<p>In 1995 the \r\n\r\nband was one of the first to release a CD-Rom. Titled Promised\r\n  Land –An Interactive Adventure it was an interesting game that led the\r\n  player through the minds of the band \r\n\r\nmembers and explored cause and effect\r\n  in a number of different ecological and moral situations.</p>\r\n<p>Queensrÿche unveiled a stripped down new sound in 1997’s Hear In\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe Now Frontier. Unfortunately two months after it’s release, the band’s\r\n  long time record company EMI went bankrupt and the tour was cut to only ten\r\n  weeks as opposed to \r\n\r\ntheir traditional year on the road.</p>\r\n<p>“The demise of EMI couldn’t have happened at any worse of a time\r\n  for us.” Tate says, “The record didn’t have a chance at all\r\n  \r\n\r\nwithout promotion and marketing, so we thought the smart thing to do was to\r\n  cut the tour short and regroup to make another record.”</p>\r\n<p>In January 1998, Chris DeGarmo \r\n\r\nannounced his departure from the band he co-founded.\r\n  After several months of discussions, the position was filled by longtime Queensrÿche\r\n  friend and producer Kelly \r\n\r\nGray.</p>\r\n<p>“I’ve known Kelly about 20 years,” Tate says, “he\r\n  fit right in and really added an important ingredient to the writing chemistry\r\n  the four of us already \r\n\r\nhad.”</p>\r\n<p>“We were the long-haired outcasts,” says drummer Scott Rockenfield,\r\n  who attended high school with Gray, “more interested in playing music\r\n  after school than \r\n\r\njust hanging out.”</p>\r\n<p>“I like to work interactively with another guitar player,” adds\r\n  guitarist Michael Wilton. “When I jammed with Kelly for the first time\r\n  it was \r\n\r\nlike an instant marriage. It was natural and just clicked. We wrote\r\n  The Right Side Of My Mind that day.”</p>\r\n<p>With Gray now in the mix, the band found themselves re-\r\n\r\nenergized, creating\r\n  compelling new songs such as the soulful “When the Rain Comes…,” the\r\n  quirky “Liquid Sky” and the sexy groove of “Sacred Ground.”</p>\r\n<p>“I hadn’t felt \r\n\r\nlike singing in a long time,” says Tate, “but\r\n  the guys just kept coming up with really inspiring music and I found myself\r\n  flooded with ideas and working at a feverish pace. \r\n\r\nPlus the general morale\r\n  of the band was at an all time high, we hadn’t felt like a band in years.”</p>\r\n<p>With the extraordinary Q2K, the new and improved Queensrÿche took \r\n\r\ntheir\r\n  music to the next plateau </p>\r\n<p>Queensrÿche toured for Q2K for a year and Kelly is now part of the family.\r\n  Still something was missing. They were not getting \r\n\r\nsupport they needed from\r\n  Atlantic and wanted to try a more aggressive and personal label. The choice\r\n  was made and the band signed with Sanctuary Records in July of 2001. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The band felt they wanted to start with Sanctuary by recapping the last 20\r\n  years with a live album and the new double live album, “Live Evolution” was\r\n  recorded at \r\n\r\nthe Moore Theater in Seattle on July 27th and 28th. \"We were\r\n  looking for a way to best describe and define what Queensrÿche has been\r\n  for the past 20 years,\" Rockenfield \r\n\r\nsays. \"After 20 years of playing\r\n  in Queensrÿche and having heard numerous live bootlegs that sound like\r\n  crap, \'Live Evolution\' is the answer for those who hold dear the \r\n\r\nmagic that\r\n  happens at a live Queensrÿche show,\" says Wilton. . The album was\r\n  released on September 25th and a DVD and VHS home video is set for release\r\n  on Oct. 9.<br \r\n\r\n/>\r\n</p>\r\n', '<li>ESP Guitars</li>', 'www.queensryche.com', 'Bridge', 'www.queensryche.com', ' June  17, 2002  @  3:41 PM', 3),

As guitarist\r\n  for pop-metal band Danger Danger until 1993, Andy toured the world \r\n\r\nopening\r\n  for Kiss and\r\n    Alice Cooper, sold over a million records worldwide, and had two #1 videos\r\n    on MTV, plus amassing a discography that includes 6 solo releases \r\n\r\nranging\r\n    from blazing guitar instrumentals, to blues, and even a Beatles/Elvis Costello-inspired\r\n    collection of pop tunes. As a session player, he’s been highly \r\n\r\nfeatured\r\n    on CD’s by drumming legend Simon Phillips, a live CD with Olivia Newton-John\r\n    (Andy has been her music director/guitarist for several U.S. tours), two\r\n    \r\n\r\ninternationally acclaimed CD’s by Kip Winger, recording sessions for\r\n    Paula Abdul, Paul Stanley, and countless radio and television jingles. He\r\n    has also played alongside \r\n\r\nmany of his heroes such as Steve Vai and Joe Satriani\r\n    (as a regular guest on their G3 tours in Dallas), Eric Johnson, Steve Morse,\r\n    Mike Stern, Ace Frehley, Ted Nugent, \r\n\r\nand Pierre Bensusan, as well as some\r\n    of his favorite \'60\'s singing stars such as The Beach Boys, Lesley Gore,\r\nand Gordon Waller (of Peter and Gordon fame!)</p>\r\n<p>The \r\n\r\nonly thing this phenomenal talent has not accomplished was releasing a\r\n  CD in America! Andy has experienced great success with several of his solo\r\n  releases in Europe and \r\n\r\nJapan, but That Was Then, This Is Now (the best of X-tacy)\r\n  is his first worldwide CD that includes a US release! This CD features 11 newly\r\n  re-mastered tracks from his first \r\n\r\ntwo highly acclaimed solo releases, ear X-tacy\r\n  and ear X-atcy 2 as well as five new songs recorded especially for this compilation\r\n  that contain some of Andy\'s best playing \r\n\r\never. Songs such as the Hendrix inspired \"Electric\r\n  Gypsy\", the homage to Stevie Ray Vaughan, \"I Remember Stevie\",\r\n  a beautiful ballad \"A Night To Remember”, the country \r\n\r\nchicken-picking\r\n  barn-burner \"Farmer Sez\", and the incredible tribute to George Harrison, \"Slips\r\n  Away\" are just a few examples of why Andy has long been respected and\r\n  \r\n\r\nadmired in the guitar community. The common thread through all these musical\r\n  genres seems to be Andy’s passionate style and sense of melody.</p>\r\n<p>Andy\'s musical career \r\n\r\nbegan in his hometown of Evansville, Indiana at the\r\n  age of 13 with his first band, Taylor Bay. “Early on, I realized that\r\n  making it in a rock band was such a long-shot, that \r\n\r\nI better figure out other\r\n  ways of making a living playing guitar. I began reading about players like\r\n  Steve Lukather and Larry Carlton who made their living as session \r\n\r\nmusicians.\r\n  This really appealed to me, since I really loved a wide variety of musical\r\n  styles.”</p>\r\n<p>The decision to pursue the studio scene led him to more serious \r\n\r\nmusic studies.\r\n  He studied classical guitar for two years before moving to Miami to study jazz\r\n  guitar at the University of Miami (largely because the Dixie Dregs, Pat \r\n\r\nMetheny,\r\n  and Jaco Pastorius had all gone there). He eventually ended up in Dallas where\r\n  he was very fortunate to get a foot in the door of a very good studio scene.\r\n  In \r\n\r\n1988, the Andy Timmons band was formed and he quickly gained a following\r\n  in Texas. Around that time, Epic recording artists Danger Danger recruited\r\n  him to finish their debut \r\n\r\nrecord, film several videos, and begin touring.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  After 4 years in New York with Danger Danger, Andy returned to Dallas in 1993\r\n    to resume his studio career and \r\n\r\nthe Andy Timmons Band. His first solo release,\r\n    ear X-tacy, was released in 1994 to critical acclaim followed by 1997\'s ear\r\n    X-tacy 2 and Pawn Kings, 1998\'s Orange \r\n\r\nSwirl, 1999\'s The Spoken and the Unspoken,\r\n  and 2000\'s double CD, And-thology 1 & 2.</p>\r\n<p>Andy has been consistently voted a “Top 20 Favorite Guitarist” in\r\n  most of \r\n\r\nJapan’s rock music magazine’s reader polls, as well as\r\n  being voted \"Musician of the Year\" four years in a row in the acclaimed\r\n  Dallas Observer Music Awards. He also has \r\n\r\nbecome one of the most respected\r\n  and sought after clinicians representing Ibanez Guitars, touring the world\r\n  on their behalf.

From his birth until his death his life\r\n  had centered around music. His impact on the \r\n\r\nguitar world may never be fully\r\n  understood, but his influence can be seen through the many guitarist in the world\r\n  of rock and roll, as well as the world of the classical \r\n\r\nguitar, that list a major\r\n  impact in their musical lives.\r\n</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">His full name is Randall William Rhoads. His love and understanding for music\r\n  \r\n\r\ncan rightfully be traced back to his mother, Delores Rhoads, and to his introduction\r\n  to music at such a young age. Mrs. Rhoads has owned and operated the Musonia\r\n  School of \r\n\r\nmusic in Burbank, CA since 1949. After graduating from UCLA with\r\n  a bachelors degree in music she taught in the Los Angeles School system before\r\n  leaving to play \r\n\r\nprofessionally and to start her Musonia. Randy\'s father was\r\n  a music teacher himself, but he left when Randy was 17 months old, leaving\r\n  Mrs. Rhoads to raise her three \r\n\r\nchildren, Randy, Kellie and Kathy, and to head\r\n  the music programs Musonia school of Music, Burbank, CA.</font></p>\r\n</font>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<font size=\"3\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, \r\n\r\nArial, sans-serif\"><strong>Early Years:\r\n</strong></font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-serif\">\r\n</font><font face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-serif\">\r\n<p><font \r\n\r\nsize=\"2\">Randy received\r\n    his first guitar at age six and a half, it was an old Gibson classical acoustic \"Army-Navy\" guitar that had belonged to his grandfather.\r\n  Randy said \r\n\r\nlater, \"I just started trying to figure out different things\r\n  on my own, so by the time I started taking lessons I had a pretty good idea\r\n  of what to do.\" He began taking \r\n\r\nlessons with his sister Kathy at his side.\r\n  To compliment his guitar lessons Mrs. Rhoads gave Randy piano lessons to sharpen\r\n  his skills at reading music and to round out his \r\n\r\nmusical education by building\r\n  a strong foundation in music theory. </font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">In the beginning he studied folk and classical. Randy had little\r\n    \r\n\r\npatience with his lessons, probably because of his insatiable desire to explore\r\n    new\r\n  ideas and expand his knowledge rather than stick to the basics. \"I did\r\n  not want to \r\n\r\nbe bothered with technique and learning scales,\" Randy said,\r\n  but it is apparent in his later works that not only did he learn these skills,\r\n  but he embraced them and took \r\n\r\nthem to there highest level combining them ways\r\n  that had never been done before. </font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">Ozzy Osbourne spoke often of Randy\'s innate ability to use\r\n  \r\n\r\n  his extensive knowledge of music in combination with current style to push\r\n    the level of musicality\r\n  to new high and to explore paths that had not yet been touched. Ozzy \r\n\r\nsaid, \"...when\r\n  we were working on the albums, I would give him a melody and he would work\r\n  a riff around it. Every hook he ever came up with I loved. He was original.\r\n  We \r\n\r\ndiscovered that most heavy metal bands stick to one key - I don\'t know about\r\n  keys or read music or really understand notes because I just get up there and\r\n  scream and jump \r\n\r\naround. ...He was so Intelligent when It came to music. I can\'t\r\n  even read music, but he knew everything. One Randy day he came to me and said\r\n  that most heavy metal songs \r\n\r\nare written in an A to E chord structure. He said,\r\n  \'Let\'s try to change that\' ...So we made a rule that almost every number that\r\n  we recorded on an album was never played \r\n\r\nin the same key.\" It was this\r\n  kind of creativity that has gained Randy a place in history as an innovator\r\n  of Rock and Roll. </font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">At Musonia, \r\n\r\nRandy had his first experience with group performance.\r\n    Mrs. Rhoads created a band-like setting focusing on a school orchestra model\r\n    to prepare\r\n  the student\'s for \r\n\r\nfuture endeavors in the public system. Mrs. Rhoads later\r\n  said, \"He couldn\'t have been more than eight years old at the time, maybe\r\n  younger. But he would sit there and play \r\n\r\nhis heart out because he enjoyed it.\r\n  He was taking things a little on his own even then. His friends flocked to\r\n  him to listen to his playing, but Randy wouldn\'t settle for \r\n\r\nthat simple type\r\n  of band music to play for his friends. He would branch out and do things that\r\n  I wouldn\'t even know, which were probably the current hits of that time. \r\n\r\nHe\r\n  was learning to read music.\"</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">Mrs. Rhoads made sure that Randy had to read music and perform\r\n    as a part of the Musonia program. \"To play \r\n\r\nin my little group that I\r\n    had even way back then, he read the charts when he played. They called them\r\n    charts; I just called\r\n  it music in those days. But he had to \r\n\r\nread, because he couldn\'t play in the\r\n  group unless he read. And then I worked with him when he was very young. I\r\n  gave him some piano lessons, so he had to learn to read. I \r\n\r\nalways make my students\r\n  count very accurately and read properly and do everything the right way, so\r\n  he had some help in that.\"</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">\"Randy grew up \r\n\r\nmusically in my school,\" Mrs. Rhoads said in an interview, \"I\r\n  am sure he was influenced by this in many ways. He started when he was so young,\r\n  he was somewhere between six-\r\n\r\nand-a-half and seven when he started lessons.\r\n  In those days, way back then, we started them with the folk guitar where they\r\n  learned the chords and a few pop \r\n\r\nsongs.\"</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">Delores recalls Randy being different from other musicians,\r\n    both young and old, \"he played with feeling, which was so important.... he \r\n\r\nwould say\r\n  \'let\'s play with real feeling even though were just playing for enjoyment\',\" Randy\'s\r\n  dedication was apparent from the start. He played sports and enjoyed all \r\n\r\nthe\r\n  things a junior high school child would do, but his music was always the first\r\n  thing in his mind. His brother Kellie Rhoads, who played in one of Randy\'s\r\n  first \r\n\r\nrock groups, remembers, \"All Randy ever wanted to do was play the\r\n  guitar. I don\'t remember him ever saying wanted to do anything else. I can\r\n  remember a time before he \r\n\r\nplayed guitar.\"</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">Randy soon gained interest in electric guitar, \"I had an old Harmony\r\n  down there and the guitar was almost larger than he was.\" \r\n\r\nsaid Mrs. Rhoads, \"it\r\n  was a semi-acoustic, and he started on that. I, fortunately, had a very good\r\n  electric guitar teacher at that time - Scott Shelly. He was very good, \r\n\r\nand\r\n  that was fortunate because he was a good teacher and gave Randy a very good\r\n  start. He made him play a lot of scales, made him use violin books for scale\r\n  material. \r\n\r\nIt was only about a year when Scott came to me and said, \'Well, I\'ve\r\n  taught Randy everything I can, he knows everything I can teach him.\' I said,\r\n  \'Oh, come on, you\'re \r\n\r\njust putting me on.\' I thought he was teasing me, but\r\n  he really meant it, that\'s the truth.\"</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">Randy attended 1st Lutheran School in Burbank and \r\n\r\nwent on to attend John Muir\r\n  Jr. High School. His High School program was condensed at Burbank High when\r\n  he graduated from a special program so that he could pursue his \r\n\r\nmusic. He received\r\n  all A\'s and B\'s in High School, but he wanted to continue with his musical\r\n  education and to teach at his mothers school so he choose to graduate \r\n\r\nearly\r\n  and begin his career.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"3\"><strong>LA Scene:</strong></font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">Randy\'s first rock band was with his brother Kellie \r\n\r\nRhoads\r\n    who would later go on to form his own band during and after Randy\'s death. \"We\r\n    got the group together when Randy was about 14 and named it Violet Fox after\r\n   \r\n\r\n my mother\'s\r\n  middle name, Violet. I played drums. Randy played rhythm guitar on a big red\r\n  Ovation; at that time, he didn\'t think he\'d ever be a lead player. This band\r\n \r\n\r\n was together for four or five months, and we played some parties and some little\r\n  shows at my mom\'s school.\"</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">\"By the time he was 13 or 14, his \r\n\r\nlittle group was playing for parties\r\n  and picnics, in the park, and down on the Burbank Mall. He was playing a lot\r\n  by then. I used to go with him and load up the equipment.,\" \r\n\r\nMrs. Rhoads\r\n  recalls.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">Kellie remembers Randy\'s attendance at his first rock concert\r\n    as a defining point in his life. In 1971 they attended \r\n\r\nan Alice Cooper concert\r\n    and it was\r\n  then that Randy realized where his life could go. Kellie recalls, \"He\r\n  never saw anything like it, and he couldn\'t talk for four \r\n\r\nhours. I think that\r\n  kind of showed him what he could do with his talent, and that\'s partly what\r\n  made him decide to play rock. Before that, he played rock guitar and I \r\n\r\nplayed\r\n  drums, but we never really thought about it.\"</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">It was soon after this that Randy found his own stage experience\r\n    confirming his desire \r\n\r\nto play Rock and Roll, \"When I first got up and\r\n    played for people, it was a fluke. These guys used to jam on a mountain in\r\n    Burbank, and\r\n  I thought that I wanted to \r\n\r\nget up and play. When I first did it, people started\r\n  clapping. A friend had shown me the beginning blues scale. That sort of showed\r\n  me how to connect the barre chords to a \r\n\r\nlittle scale. From then on, it was\r\n  just add-ons.\"</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">The Rhoads family couldn\'t afford many luxuries while Randy was growing up.\r\n  With the \r\n\r\nresponsibility of running Musonia and raising three children Mrs.\r\n  Rhoads could not even afford a hi-fi system or television. In a way this may\r\n  have inadvertantly helped \r\n\r\nshape Randy\'s style. He couldn\'t listen to much music\r\n  at home and at Musonia he was constantly surrounded by classical music and\r\n  other styles far from rock-n-roll. So \r\n\r\nRandy forced to develop musically on\r\n  his own and find his own guitar style before real exposure to rock-n-roll. </font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">When Randy was about 16 he \r\n\r\nstarted teaching at Musonia. He\r\n    was a very popular teacher from the start. He understood his students completely\r\n    and related with\r\n  them very well. \"They would come \r\n\r\nout of the room walking on clouds because\r\n  of the good experience,\" said Mrs. Rhoads. This was the first time Randy\r\n  had a chance to study other guitarists and copy their \r\n\r\nlicks and it was then\r\n  that he began to develop his own rock style. Randy spoke of this later in an\r\n  interview, \"The way I started to get a style was by teaching. People \r\n\r\nwanted\r\n  to learn everybody\'s licks, and a first that was okay. Then I thought, \'Wait\r\n  a minute - you\'ve got to get your own style.\' So I started combining what they\r\n  \r\n\r\nwanted to learn with a bit of technique. Every day with every student I\'d learn\r\n  something. When I started to get a lot of students, I thought, \'Enough with\r\n  the licks. I\'m \r\n\r\ngoing to have to get them to learn to find themselves.\'\" </font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">Randy said later in an interview, \"When you teach something\r\n    to a student, it clicks \r\n\r\nin your head. You may find the answer to another\r\n    problem you have\r\n  been trying to figure out. I taught eight hours a day, six days a week, every\r\n  half hour a different \r\n\r\nstudent. I had little kids, teenagers, and even some\r\n  older people. When you sit there and play all day long, you\'re going to develop\r\n  a lot of speed. I learned to read, too, \r\n\r\nbut I have to look at it, think about\r\n  it, and then play it. About the third time I do a piece, I can read it. I think\r\n  half of your sound comes in the way you play. A lot of \r\n\r\nit is in your hands.\r\n  If you practice with a lot of muting and then go out and do it louder onstage,\r\n  you\'ve still got the same sort of sound. You can\'t be lazy. You have to \r\n\r\nwant\r\n  to play. You have to love the guitar. I did. As a matter of fact, I was afraid\r\n  of competition because I thought that everybody was better than I was. It was\r\n  so \r\n\r\nclose to me, I thought everybody was great. Therefore I couldn\'t copy licks;\r\n  I just learned my own.\"</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">One of Randy former students, Keith Baim, \r\n\r\nnot only attributes\r\n    Randy for helping him with developing his own style but in teaching him to\r\n    feel and express the\r\n  music from within himself. He took lesson with \r\n\r\nRandy for about six months at\r\n  Musonia. \"I was extremely fond of Randy and had a great deal of respect\r\n  for him, as did his other students, who numbered in the forties or \r\n\r\nmore. Randy\r\n  had much more than talent; He had charisma. He was friendly, and, above all,\r\n  enjoyed teaching and helping others to become better players. He\'d almost \r\n\r\nalways\r\n  run late, and we would spend about half an hour a week laughing, talking, and\r\n  learning. He would say, \'Keith, make your guitar part of you. use it to express\r\n  \r\n\r\nhow you feel.\' He emphasized that phrasing is the most important aspect of\r\n  one\'s playing: \'People don\'t talk in monotone, and you shouldn\'t play guitar\r\n  that way. Accent \r\n\r\nyour playing.\' He worked very hard with me to help me develop\r\n  my own style. Needless to say, he was a huge influence and was more inspiration\r\n  than is \r\n\r\nimaginable.\"</font></p>\r\n</font>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<strong><font size=\"3\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-serif\">Quiet Riot Years:\r\n</font></strong><font face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, \r\n\r\nsans-serif\"><p><font size=\"2\">One of\r\n    his best friends in the early days when was Kelly Garni. Kelly and Randy\r\n    started playing together around 1971 and eventually formed \r\n\r\nQuiet Riot\r\n  together after combining their talents in many other bands including Milfred\r\n  Pierce, the Katzenjammer Kids and Mammoth. When they met, Randy had already\r\n  \r\n\r\nstarted to form his own style and by age 13 Randy was already making older\r\n  guitarists \"look bad\" with guitar playing that far exceeded his age. </font></p>\r\n<p><font \r\n\r\nsize=\"2\">Garni lists Randy\'s major influences in those days as Glenn\r\n    Buxton of Alice cooper and Mick Ronson of David Bowie. I was then that Randy\r\n    started \r\n\r\nexperimenting\r\n  with \"weird noises\" and \"strange sounds\" that would become\r\n  part of the Rhoads sound copied by many guitarists even today. This music was\r\n  reminiscent of \r\n\r\nBuxton. According to Garni it was at this time when Randy created\r\n  a lot of the trademark licks and Erie sounds found on his later albums with\r\n  Quite Riot and Ozzy. Kelly and \r\n\r\nRandy would routinely spend all week looking\r\n  for a gig and then every weekend playing at a party in someone\'s backyard in\r\n  Burbank. They hardly ever got paid for the gigs, \r\n\r\nbut the music was the most\r\n  important thing. Garni said of the early days, \"When Randy played they\r\n  all jumped to attention....Even though it was only a backyard, he put \r\n\r\nsuch\r\n  a good show that you felt like you were at a coliseum at a major rock gig.\r\n  He knew how to dazzle an audience.\" </font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">During these years Randy \r\n\r\nand Kelly became well known in the\r\n    area and created a quite a local reputation for themselves which helped launch\r\n    their next band\r\n  Quiet Riot. In 1975 Randy and \r\n\r\nKelly formed Quiet Riot. After years of backyard\r\n  bands they wanted something more \"formal\". So they audition for a\r\n  lead singer and found Kevin DuBrow. Kevin\'s audition was \r\n\r\nheld in the kitchen\r\n  at Mrs. Rhoads house. She remembers the day well, \"Kevin saying, \'Well\r\n  if you don\'t like me just say so and I\'ll leave.\' Randy and Kelly said, \r\n\r\n\'Now\r\n  wait a minute, there are probably some things we have to work out. Let\'s talk\r\n  about it.\' That was actually the very first day for Quiet Riot.\"</font></p>\r\n<p><font \r\n\r\nsize=\"2\">Kevin recalled that day in a later interview, \"He was\r\n    just 17 at the time; I was 18. He had hair down to his waist and a thumbnail\r\n    about four inches\r\n  long. \r\n\r\nI looked at him and thought, \'No way can this guy play.\' But I figured\r\n  what the hell, and went over to his house to hear him play through this tiny\r\n  amp. He plugged in, and \r\n\r\nI thought that my head was being plastered against\r\n  the wall; every lead that I could ever imagine - he played them better than\r\n  anybody I\'d ever heard on \r\n\r\nrecord.\"</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">Randy and Garni worked with Kevin until they decided to add him to the line-up.\r\n  The original band members of Quite Riot included Randy on \r\n\r\nguitar, Kelly Garni\r\n  on bass, Kevin DuBrow on vocals and Chris Forsyth on Drums.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">Within a year Quiet Riot was the hottest band around. Soon\r\n    \r\n\r\nthey were regulars at \"Starwood\" in Santa Monica. Still playing basically for free,\r\n  but to them the music was all that mattered. In the early days in the rock\r\n  scene groups \r\n\r\nwrote most of their own music and \"Aside from playing guitar,\" Garni\r\n  said, \"Randy came up with a lot of the songs, too... Randy would come\r\n  up with an idea and then we\'d all \r\n\r\njump on it; I think that\'s how a lot of bands\r\n  go about. Randy was a very prolific writer, too - he\'d always have something\r\n  new. In the early years he and I came up with a \r\n\r\nlot of riffs to jam on, but\r\n  later on when Kevin came in and he and Randy wrote most of the songs.\"</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">Quite Riot performed four or five gigs a week \r\n\r\nand soon created\r\n    enough excitement that they landed a record deal with Japan\'s CBS Sony record\r\n    label. As Garni\r\n  put it in a later interview, \"Well, we scored the \r\n\r\ndeal to do the two Japanese\r\n  albums and they did very well over there. I still have a stack of letters from\r\n  fans there and we got some big write-ups in the magazines, too. \r\n\r\nThey kept calling\r\n  us the \'Next Big Thing\' and the \'New Sound\' in music.\" </font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">After the success of the Japanese albums Quiet Riot tried to\r\n    \r\n\r\nno avail to put together a tour and to land an American record contract. \"The only thing\r\n  that was bad about it was that the records were never out here. So, it kind\r\n  of made \r\n\r\nfeet like you really never had a record deal. You got the record and\r\n  you were able to look at it, but you sure as hell couldn\'t go in some record\r\n  store and buy it because, \r\n\r\nback then, imports weren\'t really that big of a thing,\" said\r\n  Garni. </font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">In 1978-9 Garni left the band to pursue a career as a paramedic. It was \r\n\r\nthen\r\n  that Rudy Sarazo joined the group as the new bassist and although he appeared\r\n  on the cover picture of Quiet Riot II album, he didn\'t play on either of the\r\n  \r\n\r\nJapanese releases. </font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">A few months before the breakup of Quite Riot Randy went to\r\n    the guitar workshop of Karl Sandoval and asked him to make a \r\n\r\nguitar for him.\r\n    Sondoval created one\r\n  of Randy\'s trademark polk-a-dot guitars. As Sandoval and Randy had several\r\n  meetings to discuss the creation of the now famous \r\n\r\nguitar. Randy had drawn\r\n  pictures of the new instrument and had all the details of the guitar well thought\r\n  out. The shape as well as the color of his new guitar would, from \r\n\r\nthen on,\r\n  be associated with Randy. He wanted a Flying V shape, tremolo unit, double\r\n  humbucking pickups, and one volume and one tone control per pickup. Sandoval\r\n  \r\n\r\ndescribed the guitar in detail in a later interview, \"The guitar has an\r\n  old \'60\'s non-adjustable Danelectro neck that has been shaved and modified\r\n  to look somewhat like an \r\n\r\narrowhead. It has a rosewood fingerboard and a wide,\r\n  flat feel. The action is very comfortable. The tuners are standard Schallers.\r\n  The thing that was different about it was \r\n\r\nthe Strat-style side-mount jack underneath\r\n  the V section, which was one of his ideas. he also wanted the toggle switches\r\n  at the end of the wing. Polka dots were used because \r\n\r\nthey were like his trademark,\r\n  and the inlay on the fingerboard is supposed to resemble bow ties. Both of\r\n  these were his ideas, too.\"</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">Quite \r\n\r\nriot had a large following in the years with Sarazo.\r\n    Rudy later said that Randy was the \"focal point of the band\" his polk-a-dot theme\r\n  expressed in his guitar and his \r\n\r\nclothing was copied by many of his fans. \"It\r\n  was great! ...you\'d see a bunch of little kids with his haircut wearing little\r\n  polka dot bow ties and vests, trying to be like \r\n\r\nhim. And then there were a\r\n  lot of clone Randy Rhoads guitar players in bands,\" Sarazo said.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">Quite Riot eventually broke up in 1980. Randy thought \r\n\r\nat the\r\n    time that Quiet Riot might make it, but later, during his tour with Ozzy\r\n    he said, \"...now\r\n  that I\'m away, I knew it wouldn\'t. I have to say that. It was \r\n\r\nkind of like\r\n  I was growing up at the time and didn\'t know it. There\'s a lot more room for\r\n  guitar in this band than in Quiet Riot,\"</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">Sarazo \r\n\r\nsaid later. \"[We] didn\'t do much traveling - we\r\n    went from Oxnard down to Riverside. We mainly were an LA club band, doing\r\n    weekends at the Starwood\r\n  or Golden West \r\n\r\nBallroom. We didn\'t get an American record deal, which is one\r\n  of the reasons why Quiet Riot broke up.\"</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">\"That was frustrating,\" Randy stated. \"We \r\n\r\nthought\r\n    we were good, yet the record companies kept turning us down. We thought the\r\n    success of Van Halen would help us, but actually It hurt. Most of the record\r\n    \r\n\r\ncompany people would\r\n  say, We don\'t want the second LA. metal band. \'That\'s why we released the albums\r\n  In Japan. There\'s a big market for rock and roll there, and at that \r\n\r\ntime we\r\n  were just thrilled to get our records out no matter where It was.\"<br />\r\n</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"3\"><strong>Ozzy:</strong></font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">Randy \r\n\r\ngot the call for the Ozzy audition just before the last\r\n    Quiet riot gig. Ozzy Osbourne, formerly of Black Sabbath, had recently broke\r\n    from the group\r\n  and was looking \r\n\r\nfor a guitarist. Although Randy had not been much of a fan\r\n  of Ozzy he accepted the invitation and went for the audition. Mrs. Rhoads talked\r\n  to Randy before about the \r\n\r\npossibility of him playing with an already established\r\n  band if was offered the chance would he take a gig like this one and Randy\r\n  answer was \"of course.\" Now was Randy\'s \r\n\r\nopportunity.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">Ozzy had gone through scores of guitarists in Los Angeles and\r\n    New York and the night before he was scheduled to leave for England \r\n\r\nRandy\r\n    showed up at his\r\n  motel room in Malibu at 2 o\'clock in the morning for the audition. Most of\r\n  the guitarists before had shown up with Marshall stacks, big \r\n\r\nattitudes and\r\n  one even had black plastic fingertips imitating Ozzy\'s former black Sabbath\r\n  guitarist Toni Iommi. But Randy stood out from the rest by his calm and \r\n\r\nunimposing\r\n  demeanor. He brought in a little amp and plugged in and began to play. Randy\r\n  recalled later, \"I just tuned, up and did some riffs, and he said, \'You\'ve\r\n  got \r\n\r\nthe gig.\' I had the weirdest feeling, because I thought, \'You didn\'t even\r\n  hear me yet.\'\" Randy elaborated later in another interview, \"Possibly\r\n  he knew a certain sound \r\n\r\nhe was looking for, and all these other players tried\r\n  to show off too much. I didn\'t get a chance to show off. I just started making\r\n  a few harmonics, and maybe perhaps it \r\n\r\nwas my personality, because I was really\r\n  quiet and everybody was too outgoing. I still don\'t know.\"</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">It took two months for the details to get \r\n\r\nworked out and then Randy was off\r\n  to London as the lead guitarist of the newly formed Blizzard of Ozz. They arrived\r\n  in England in September of 1980 and began working on \r\n\r\ntheir first album. They\r\n  were in the studio for six weeks writing and recording the first of two studio\r\n  albums featuring Randy and by Christmas it was \r\n\r\ncomplete.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">Ozzy and Randy had a great rapport together from the start.\r\n    The differences in their respective musical approaches filled in the \r\n\r\ngaps\r\n    in each others abilities\r\n  and they became an extremely complimentary writing team. Ozzy had the experience\r\n  in studios and techniques of song writing and Randy\'s \r\n\r\nfresh approach and creativity\r\n  added to the unique quality of their first album \"Blizzard of Ozz\",\r\n  an LP of a sort that had never been heard. Randy\'s patience and solid \r\n\r\nmusicianship\r\n  drove Ozzy to a new creative high. \"They [Black Sabbath] never had the\r\n  patience to try and listen to where I was coming from. Randy Rhoads was the\r\n  first \r\n\r\nguy who ever sat down with me and listened to my humming and worked with\r\n  it,\" Ozzy said. </font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">Randy was a patient creator, much the opposite of Ozzy. \r\n\r\nOzzy\r\n    once said, \"Randy\r\n  I\'m stumped on this section and we\'re gonna need a track for the album and\r\n  it\'s driving me nuts.\" And Randy would comfort Ozzy with the \r\n\r\nreply, \"Don\'t\r\n  worry we\'ll get one.\" Ozzy would later attribute the success of his solo\r\n  the success and the success of the first two albums to Randy. He later said\r\n  of \r\n\r\nRandy, \"I fell in love with Randy as a player and a person the instant\r\n  I saw him. He had the best smile in the world. Randy was the best guy in the\r\n  world to work with. There \r\n\r\nis no comparison between him and Tony Iommi, and\r\n  I can only compare the two because they were the only guitar players I had\r\n  ever worked with. I was attracted to Randy\'s \r\n\r\nangelic attitude towards the whole\r\n  business. I didn\'t have to teach him anything; all that he was lacking was\r\n  guidance. He listened to every word I spoke to him, and we had \r\n\r\na great rapport\r\n  together.\"</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">When the first tour began the crowds would cheer for Ozzy,\r\n    but soon an equal amount of the audience was coming \r\n\r\nto see the newest sensation\r\n    in rock-n-roll\r\n  - Randy Rhoads. \"Together we were magic.\" Ozzy said, \"...we\r\n  had a very<br />\r\n  special rapport. We were total opposites \r\n\r\noff stage - he didn\'t drink and was<br />\r\n  quiet, while I\'ve always been [crazy] ...yet on stage we just clicked.\" </font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">Ozzy\'s insane stage presence \r\n\r\nhelped Randy open up more and\r\n    give even a greater performances than in the past. \"Before I met Ozzy I was very insecure\r\n  on stage,\" Randy said. \"If my amps acted up, or the \r\n\r\nsound system\r\n  wasn\'t good, it really affected my playing. Being with Ozzy has given me a\r\n  great deal of self confidence. He pushed me into trying things and doing things\r\n  \r\n\r\nI never would have done on my own.\"</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">Randy never considered himself a rock and roll star. He always\r\n    felt strange with that label. \"I\'ve always \r\n\r\nviewed myself as a musician.\r\n    I never thought of myself as a star. Ozzy\'s a star - I\'m just part of the\r\n    band,\" Randy\r\n  would say. The critics opinions didn\'t matter \r\n\r\nto much to the new guitar icon.\r\n  He was quoted as saying \"As long as I\'m satisfied with my work, I\'m not\r\n  too concerned with what any critics think. Our type of music will \r\n\r\nnever be\r\n  a critical favorite, but when I can stand on a stage and see a lot of smiling\r\n  faces in the crowd, it makes it all worthwhile.\" The audience was the\r\n  most \r\n\r\nimportant critic and as long as they were happy Randy was. </font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">Their next album, Diary of a Madman was recorded immediately\r\n    after their Blizzard. \r\n\r\n\"We\r\n  recorded Diary quickly,\" Ozzy said, \"I hate being in a recording\r\n  studio to begin with, but working with Randy and Bob Daisley was a new and\r\n  refreshing experience \r\n\r\nfor me. I was working with guys that didn\'t have to do\r\n  it, they wanted to do it. I got that old spark again. Diary was the better\r\n  of the two albums as songs go. The mix \r\n\r\nwasn\'t too clever but we weren\'t there\r\n  for the mix, we were back out on the road.\" </font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">On the road Randy was known for his stellar live \r\n\r\nperformances. \"Some\r\n  nights Randy would give me a spine chill. His playing was so unpredictable\r\n  live. He wouldn\'t think about it, he would just go for it. He wouldn\'t \r\n\r\nwonder\r\n  if it would fit the song structure, he would just play his ideas as if they\r\n  were there anyway.\" Ozzy later said.</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\">Several weeks before \r\n\r\nhis death Randy express interest in leaving\r\n    Ozzy to pursue a degree in classical guitar at a University setting. During\r\n    the Diary tour\r\n  he said to Ozzy \"I want to \r\n\r\nlearn to play classical guitar.\" I said,\r\n  \'You\'re crazy, just play rock and roll and make some bucks.\" He said, \"I\r\n  want to do it.\" So he started going to these seminars. \r\n\r\nEvery town we\'d\r\n  go into, he\'d look in the phone book for classical instructors. Seven weeks\r\n  later, the classical stuff he was playing was unbelievable. Seven weeks. He\r\n \r\n\r\n worked around the clock to get where he wanted.\"<br />\r\n</font></p>\r\n<p><font size=\"2\"><strong><font size=\"3\">March 1982:</font></strong></font></p>\r\n</font><font \r\n\r\nsize=\"3\">\r\n</font>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><em><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, sans-serif\">Associated Press </font></em></p>\r\n<p><em><font size=\"2\" face=\"Trebuchet MS, Arial, \r\n\r\nsans-serif\">March 20, 1982, Leesburg, Fla.

At home, he listened to a lot of \r\n\r\nmusic ( Beatles,\r\n50s and 60s stuff ). He also was influenced by his uncle Jimmy Kidd, a blues-player\r\nfrom the WA-area.\r\n<p>Paul worked on his playing quite a bit, and later \r\n\r\nattended the GIT. Not only\r\n  is he still one of their most outstanding students, he also won the \"LA\r\n  Guitar Wars\", and he also started to teach at the GIT for a while, at\r\na \r\n\r\nvery young age. ( in 1987 )</p>\r\n\r\nDuring his time as a student, Paul established the metalband Racer X. They set\r\nout to be the fastest, loudest and most extreme metal-band \r\n\r\naround. Not only did\r\nthey write some really cool metal-tunes, they also showcased Paul\'s amazing talent\r\nas a player (later in combination with fellow shredder Bruce \r\n\r\nBouillet).\r\n<p>And they really had a cool sense of humour. Don\'t take all that \"serious\" metal-attitude\r\n  too serious. They simply had fun playing some very fast and loud heavy \r\n\r\nmetal.</p>\r\n<p>The band recorded their debut, \"Street Lethal\", which started off\r\n  with the mind-boggling guitar solo \"Frenzy\", and also featured \"Y.R.O.\",\r\n  a \r\n\r\nmetalinstrumental featuring Paul\'s version of Niccolo Paganini\'s \"Perpetual\r\n  Motion\".</p>\r\n<p>The band played out a lot in the LA-area, and eventually gained some \r\n\r\nnotoriety.\r\n  They recorded their next album, \"Second Heat\", which again was heavy,\r\n  fast and loud. (feat. Scott Travis on drums and Bruce Bouillet on guitar).\r\n  The songs \r\n\r\nwere based on very cool metal-riffs, and featured extremely fast\r\n  and wild guitar solos plus some amazing unisono-leads of Paul and Bruce. The\r\n  band was rehearsing like crazy, \r\n\r\nand the result of that is documented on the\r\n  two live-CDs \"Extreme Volume 1\" and \"Extreme Volume 2\".</p>\r\n<p>A while later, Paul quit to join a new project of Billy Sheehan. \r\n\r\nThat project\r\n  was called Mr. Big and featured Gilbert, Sheehan, Pat Torpey on drums and Eric\r\n  Martin on vocals. The debut was pretty successful and the band played live\r\n  \r\n\r\nall over the world, i.e. as an opener for Rush.</p>\r\n<p>The sophomore album \"Lean Into It\" became their most successful\r\n  release... it featured the megahit \"To Be With You\", \r\n\r\nwhich was No.1\r\n  in several countries. </p>\r\n<p>With Mr. Big, Paul showed that he also was a great \"band-guitarist\",\r\n  cutting back on the speed a bit, playing some quite \r\n\r\nmelodic and tasteful leads.\r\n  Still, live, he really ripped, as documented on the video \"Mr. Big Live\r\n  In San Francisco\". His guitar-solo on that one is amazing.</p>\r\n<p>To \r\n\r\nmake a long story short, Paul toured with the band quite a bit, recorded\r\n  a few more albums with them, and eventually quit to pursuit a solo-career.\r\n  In 1998, he released his \r\n\r\nfirst \"real\" solo album (not counting the \"Tribute\r\n  To Jimi Hendrix\")\"King Of Clubs\", an album filled with really\r\n  cool pop- and rock-tunes, full of great melodies. Also \r\n\r\nfeaturing \"The\r\n  Jam\", an 18minute jam between Paul and Bruce B. There are some really\r\n  astonishing licks on that one !</p>\r\n<p>To this day, Paul is releasing solo-albums, \r\n\r\nfocussing on great songwriting\r\n  ( also handling lead-vocals ) in combination with ripping guitar-solos.

This list includes Joni \r\n\r\nMitchell,\r\nGeorge Harrison and Miles Davis, to name just a few.\r\n<p>Robben started lessons on the saxaphone at age 10 and began teaching himself\r\n  guitar at age 13. He \r\n\r\ngravitated towards blues and R & B, and his first\r\n  professional job was playing guitar and saxaphone for Chicago blues harpist\r\n  Charlie Musslewhite at age 18. After a year \r\n\r\nwith Charlie, Robben formed a band\r\n  with his brothers, Patrick (drums) and Mark (blues harp) known as the Charles\r\n  Ford band,named after their father. They recorded one record \r\n\r\nfor the Arhoolie\r\n  label. </p>\r\n<p>Moving to Los Angeles, Robben joined up with the great blues singer Jimmy\r\n  Witherspoon touring Europe and the U.S. He was heard during this \r\n\r\ntime by members\r\n  of the L.A. fusion group L.A. Express, and was invited to tour with Joni Mitchell,\r\n  the band opening for Joni and also accompanying her on her set. This \r\n\r\nresulted\r\n  in two recordings with Joni \"Hissing of Summer Lawns\" and \"Miles\r\n  of Aisles\" recorded live, as well as two records with Tom Scott and the\r\n  L.A.

Robben then signed with Elektra Records, releasing\r\n  his first solo record \"The \r\n\r\nInside Story.\" This marked the beginning\r\n  of the group Yellowjackets, resulting in two records for Warner Brothers, with\r\n  Robben appearing as a special guest soloist with the \r\n\r\nY.J\'s. </p>\r\n<p>After some time spent touring and recording for Michael Mcdonald, an invitation\r\n  from Miles Davis came along, and Robben toured with his idol for six \r\n\r\nmonths,\r\n  leaving to record his grammy- nominated recording \"Talk To Your Daughter,\" released\r\n  in 1988.<br>\r\n  Finding some like-minded musicians to tour the album, the group \r\n\r\nThe Blue Line\r\n  was formed. Robben Ford and The Blue Line recorded three successful albums\r\n  together for the Stretch/Blue Thumb label, two of which were also nominated\r\n  for \r\n\r\ngrammy awards. The band toured the world over several years and decided\r\n  to take a break in 1997.

Drums \r\n\r\nwere his first\r\n  instrument,\r\n  but by age eight he had switched to guitar. By his early teens, Al was already\r\n  an accomplished player, though he felt somewhat ostracized \r\n\r\nfrom the local clique\r\n  of musicians. \"In the \'60s, if you didn\'t play like Eric Clapton or Jimi\r\n  Hendrix or Jimmy Page, you weren\'t accepted,\" he recalls of his high \r\n\r\nschool\r\n  years in Bergenfield, New Jersey. \"So I was never really accepted by that\r\n  group of so-called friends in Bergenfield because they didn\'t know what to\r\n  make of my \r\n\r\nstyle. Even though I wanted to learn Beatles and Ventures music\r\n  when I\r\n  began taking lessons, my teacher (Bob Aslanian) also made me learn jazz and\r\n  bossa nova and a \r\n\r\nlittle classical, so I had all this technique that my friends\r\n  couldn\'t\r\n  understand. It never fit the kind of music that they were playing. They were\r\n  interested in my \r\n\r\ntechnique, but at the same time they were jealous of it.\"</p>\r\n<p>A big influence on his music outlook during his formative years was the burgeoning\r\n  hybrid of rock and jazz \r\n\r\nthat came to be known as fusion music. Guitarist Larry\r\n  Coryell, whom Al later dubbed \"The Father Of Fusion,\" became a particular\r\n  focus of interest. \"I used to ride the bus \r\n\r\nfrom New Jersey to see him\r\n  play at little clubs in Greenwich Village,\" he recalls. \"Wherever\r\nhe was playing, I\'d be there.\" </p>\r\n<p>Following an intensive period of \r\n\r\nwoodshedding between his junior and senior\r\n  years in high school, in which he practiced the guitar from eight to ten hours\r\n  a day, Al emerged with impressive chops and a clear \r\n\r\nidea of how to apply them. \"I\r\n  was trying to find myself, or find the kind of music that suited where I was\r\n  going with the guitar,\" he told Down Beat. \"I had grown up on \r\n\r\nrock\r\n  and loved it, but found it a very limited kind of music for expansion on your\r\n  instrument. I started listening to bluegrass, especially Doc Watson, which\r\n  really \r\n\r\nhelped me develop my speed. I really dug Tal Farlow and Kenny Burrell\r\n  at the time, but I also knew that it wasn\'t what I ultimately wanted to do.\r\n  I wanted to do something \r\n\r\nnew, something nobody was doing.\" </p>\r\n<p></p>\r\nIn 1971, Al enrolled at the Berklee School of Music in Boston. By the second\r\nsemester, he was playing in a fusion quartet led \r\n\r\nby keyboardist Barry Miles.\r\nIt was in the early part of 1974 that he received the fateful call from Chick\r\nCorea. \"I was just sitting around my apartment in Boston on a Friday \r\n\r\nafternoon\r\nwhen Chick called and asked me to come to a rehearsal in New York,\" he recalls. \"I\r\ncouldn\'t believe it. It was really a dream come true. In 10 minutes I \r\n\r\npacked\r\nsome clothes in a bag, got a ride to New York and never saw that apartment in\r\nBoston again.\" Following a weekend of rehearsals with that band, Return\r\nto Forever, Di \r\n\r\nMeola made his debut with RTF at Carnegie Hall. The next night\r\nhe played to a crowd of 40,000 in Atlanta. His star quickly ascended.\r\n<p>After three wildly successful landmark \r\n\r\nfusion albums with Corea on keyboards,\r\n  Stanley Clarke on bass, Lenny White on drums and Di Meola on guitar—Where\r\n  Have I Known You Before, the Grammy Award winning No Mystery \r\n\r\nand Romantic Warrior—RTF\r\n  disbanded in 1976, effectively launching Al\'s solo career. He called the breakup\r\n  a blessing in disguise. \"It was probably for the best because we \r\n\r\neach\r\n  got a chance to develop our own careers and get to know what it was like to\r\n  be a leader and producer and just be out on our own.\" </p>\r\n<p>He debuted in 1976 with \r\n\r\nLand Of The Midnight Sun, a typically blazing showcase\r\n  of his frenetic, slashing style which also featured performances by drummers\r\n  Lenny White and Steve Gadd, percussionist \r\n\r\nMingo Lewis, synth wizards Jan Hammer\r\n  and Barry Miles, bassists Anthony Jackson and Jaco Pastorius. Over the course\r\n  of six more albums with Columbia Records—Casino, Elegant \r\n\r\nGypsy, Splendido\r\n  Hotel, Electric Rendezvous, Tour De Force and Scenario—Di Meola firmly\r\n  established himself as a powerful and influential force in contemporary music.\r\n  \r\n\r\nHe went on to record a string of highly evocative, pan-global projects for\r\n  the Manhattan/EMI, Tomato and Mesa/Bluemoon labels before signing with Telarc.\r\n  Di Meola continued \r\n\r\nto conquer new musical horizons on The Infinite Desire,\r\n  his 1998 Telarc debut, which featured his most extensive and effective use\r\n  of midi technology ever. The Infinite \r\n\r\nDesire has sold more than 100,000 copies\r\nto date and logged over 3 months on Billboard\'s Contemporary Jazz Chart. </p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n1999 saw the release of Di Meola\'s first-ever \r\n\r\nseasonal recording, Winter Nights,\r\nwhich featured original compositions alongside renditions of traditional carols\r\nand contemporary standards like Peter Gabriel\'s \"Mercy \r\n\r\nStreet\" and\r\nPaul Simon\'s \"Scarborough Fair.\" Elegant, melodic, and beautifully\r\ncrafted, Winter Nights also included the extraordinary work of Roman Hrynkiv\r\non bandura, a \r\n\r\nUkranian folk instrument with an enchanting sound and texture.\r\n<p>On The Grande Passion, released in October 2000, Di Meola continued to explore\r\n  melody and rhythmic diversity \r\n\r\nwith the help of his acoustic group, World Sinfonia.\r\n  Due in August 2002, his fourth Telarc release, Flesh On Flesh, puts the spotlight\r\n  back on his outstanding electric \r\n\r\nguitar work. The Los Angeles Times recently\r\n  summed it up best when the paper wrote, \"Al Di Meola is much more than\r\n  fast playing now, having matured into a far more complete \r\n\r\nartist...And that\r\n  maturity is apparent in his attraction to and wide array of musical elements\r\n  from around the world, and in his own spare and thoughtful soloing.\" <br \r\n\r\n/>\r\n</p>\r\n', 'Unknown', 'www.aldimeola.com', ' Race With Devil', 'www.aldimeola.com', ' June  10, 2002  @  3:33 PM', 3);

Lucille was in delicate \r\n\r\nhealth and was barely eighteen. She was poor and\r\n  had no home. Her new husband James was\r\n  a private in the US Army far away in Alabama. Jimi was to be three years old\r\n  \r\n\r\nbefore James(Al) was discharged. Jimi had been shunted around among friends\r\n  and relatives all of his early life, while his\r\n  mother drank heavily and ran with a bad crowd. \r\n\r\nWhen Al returned, he and Lucille\r\n  were reunited. They settled and raised Jimi as a family. In November of 1946,\r\n  Jimi’s\r\n  father changed Jimi’s name to James Marshall \r\n\r\nHendrix in honor of his\r\n  dead uncle. </p>\r\n<p>During this happy period in Jimi’s life, music entered his world. Jimi\r\n  remembered his parents practicing dance moves to the \r\n\r\nsound of Duke Ellington.\r\n  His parents entered dance contests often, and his father tap danced with touring\r\n  shows. Jimi also sang with the Church of Christ and God. While Jimi \r\n\r\nwas in\r\n  kindergarten(‘48),\r\n  Al went back to school to train as an electrician, under his GI bill, and Lucille\r\n  watched Jimi and Leon. But unfortunately, money was short. \r\n\r\nLucille would often\r\n  disappear for days at a time. Over the next three years, Jimi and Leon witnessed\r\n  arguments, separations, and reunions. On December 17 of 1951, Al and \r\n\r\nLucille\r\n  divorced. Al gained custody of Jimi, Leon, and Joseph (born in 1949, but was\r\n  fostered out most of the time). The boys seldom lived at home and were frequently \r\n\r\n“shunted” among\r\n  relatives and friends. “\r\n  Eventually, Al simply couldn’t cope with the two children and placed\r\n  Leon in a foster home.” This hurt Jimi greatly. Leon was \r\n\r\nJimi’s\r\n  only “constant security”,\r\n  and sensitive Jimi became even more withdrawn; he also developed a stutter\r\n  as well. Jimi retreated into a world of fantasy; he would \r\n\r\noften pretend to\r\n  be a sci-fi hero. “\r\n  At school, he escaped through poetry and art” Jimi was beginning to develop\r\n  the inner world that would later influence his song \r\n\r\nwriting. </p>\r\n<p>By the age of eight, Jimi was\r\n  showing signs of musical talent. He would pick up a broom and strum it like\r\n  a guitar, and accompany it with the sound of \r\n\r\nElvis Presley song lyrics. Jimi\r\n  would even take the broom to school. One day, while Al was doing yardwork,\r\n  he found an old ukulele. He restrang it and gave it to Jimi in \r\n\r\n1955. Just as\r\n  Jimi was beginning to express himself, he suffered a tragic blow. In December\r\n  of 1957, Jimi’s mother Lucille went in and out of the hospital\r\n  in Seattle, \r\n\r\ndiagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver. Jimi saw her often and proudly\r\n  showed her his latest artwork. Early in 1958, Lucille went back into the hospital.\r\n  On February 2,1958, \r\n\r\n“Lucille\r\n  died of a ruptured spleen brought on by a failing liver. Jimi did not attend\r\n  the funeral ostensibly because there was no one to take him.” At the\r\n  age of 15, \r\n\r\nfragile Jimi lost his mother, but in the aftermath of that tragedy,\r\na rare talent was to be born. </p>\r\n<p>“\r\n  In the year of his mother’s death, Jimi Hendrix got his first \r\n\r\nguitar.” In\r\n  the fall of 1958, Jimi joined his first band, The Velvetones. During the summer\r\n  of 1959, Al bought Jimi an electric guitar, which allowed Jimi to play in a\r\n  \r\n\r\ndifferent band, The Rocking Kings; Jimi made his live debut with them. After\r\n  Jimi dropped out of high school in October of 1960, he joined\r\n  the US Army by lying about his \r\n\r\nage. On October 31,1961, Jimi joined the 101st\r\n  Airborne Division and starts parachute training. During his 26th jump, Jimi\r\n  broke his ankle and had to leave\r\nthe army. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n  <em><strong>THE BEGINNING OF A LEGEND </strong></em></p>\r\n<p>Jimi then goes to Nashville as a musician-for-hire in October of 1962. These\r\n  few years \r\n\r\n(1962-66) are rich in Jimi’s musical development. Jimi played\r\n  in backup bands for The Isley Brothers, Jackie Wilson, Little Richard, B.B.King,\r\n  and Ike & Tina Turner. Jimi \r\n\r\nsaid,” But it was not me, but\r\n  the others who got famous.” In\r\n  June of 1966, Jimi forms the band Jimmy James and The Blue Flames. During a\r\n  performance of the band at the \r\n\r\nCafe Wha? in Manhattan, Keith Richards’ girlfriend,\r\n  Linda Keith, tries to interest The Rolling Stones’ manager in Jimi. Her\r\n  attempts fail, but she didn’t give up. Linda \r\n\r\nbrought The Animal’s\r\n  bassist, Chas Chandler along with his partner Mike Jeffery in to see Jimi.\r\n  They were interested in Jimi, and Chas offered to manage him. Chas told Jimi, \r\n\r\n”I\r\n  believe you’ll be a great sensation in England. If you agree I’ll\r\n  pay your fare to London, look after you and manage your affairs.” Jimi\r\n  replied,” Well, if you take \r\n\r\nme to England you’ve gotta take\r\n  me to meet Eric Clapton.” This apparently clinched the deal. When Jimi\r\n  and Chas arrived in London, Chas found gigs in nightclubs immediately. \r\n\r\nChas\r\n  introduced Jimi to Mick Jagger and The Beatles, John Lennon became one of Jimi’s\r\n  biggest fans ; he arranged for a jam session with Cream, Eric Clapton’s\r\n  band. Eric \r\n\r\nwas impressed with Jimi and remembered being blown away. While Jimi\r\n  was playing in the nightclubs, he met future bassist, Noel Redding, on September\r\n  29,1966; he also met \r\n\r\ndrummer Mitch Mitchell, and the three founded\r\n  the band The Jimi Hendrix Experience on October 5,1966.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n  <strong><em>THE JIMI HENDRIX EXPERIENCE \r\n\r\n</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>The Experience played live for the first time in Evreux, which is near Paris,\r\n  on October 13,1966. After returning to London, they record “Hey Joe” \r\n\r\nwith\r\n  producer Chas Chandler on October 23. On February 3,1967, they record “Purple\r\n  Haze” and\r\n  work on “The Wind Cries Mary”. March 31st, The Experience began\r\n  a \r\n\r\ncontroversial UK tour with the Walker Brothers. The Walker Brothers were\r\n  on their farewell tour and were major English sex symbols. Chas thought Jimi\r\n  could take over their \r\n\r\nposition as sex symbols, if they timed it right. They\r\n  worked on a flamboyant, sexual act which would make Jimi famous\r\n  for being a “wild man”. When Chas saw the audiences’ \r\n\r\nreaction\r\n  and the stir in the press, he knew they had hit the jackpot and used it. Jimi\r\n  did not take the act seriously; he only wanted his music to be heard. His manager\r\n  \r\n\r\nsaid it was the only way for him to be successful, especially since he was\r\n  black. Jimi played the game, unaware of the problems it would cause later.  </p>\r\n<p>The following \r\n\r\nare articles involving the tour: </p>\r\n<p>“\r\n  Last year a musician...were brought to London where he got a serious breakthrough.\r\n  This is all about Jimi Hendrix, who climbed \r\n\r\nhigh on the charts from hi first\r\n  record ‘Hey\r\n  Joe’. At the moment the follower ‘Purple Haze’ is among the\r\n  five most sold records in England....</p>\r\n<p>Jimi Hendrix \r\n\r\nsometimes plays so temperamental,\r\n  that his...amplifier explodes, as it happened a concert in England last month.” (Eksra\r\n  Bladet5-15-67) </p>\r\n<p>“It\r\n  is gonna be a \r\n\r\npop-weekend for popfans....Sunday the big name in British pop\r\n  Jimi Hendrix gives a concert in Falkoner Centret....He is a big name in England\r\n  ...his guitar playing are \r\n\r\nbetter than most pop people, he has more blues feeling,\r\n  it is more directly and artistic....” (Berlingske\r\n  Tidende5-17-67)“  </p>\r\n<p>On Sunday the worlds most sensational \r\n\r\nguitarist Jimi Hendrix and his group\r\n  The Jimi Hendrix Experience will give their first concert in Denmark in Falkoner\r\n  Centret in Kobenhavn. Jimi Hendrix is known for a stage \r\n\r\nshow that is prohibited\r\n  in several areas in England.”\r\n  (Borge5-18-67) </p>\r\n<p>The following is my personal favorite of the newspaper articles. <br />\r\n</p>\r\n<p>“ With \r\n\r\nthe most provoking performance ever seen on a Danish stage, Jimi\r\n  Hendrix drew in a capacity crowd with his electrified sex, last night at the\r\n  Falkoner. There was such a \r\n\r\nviolent reaction, that his rape attempts on the\r\n  amplifier and   the guitar seemed to have worked organically on each individual. Hendrix\r\n    plays with his teeth, he simply \r\n\r\nputs the guitar strings to his mouth and\r\n  bites them. The elbows are used for rubbing the strings- and in every case\r\n  it is the master who is playing. Jimi Hendrix must be \r\n\r\nseen and experienced.\r\n  It is true that his music is in a special class, but it is just as much his\r\n  overall performing, behavior, and appearance which makes him a \r\n\r\nphenomenon.”\r\n  (AK5-22-67) </p>\r\n<p>“... in 67 he came to Sweden. Sweden was a test, if it went\r\n    great for him they would stake a lot on him internationally. The same \r\n\r\nwith\r\n  the Beatles in 63. They made their first foreign tour in Sweden before they\r\n  tried the USA....Fifteen thousand\r\n  showed up for Jimi’s first concert at Grona Lund, \r\n\r\naudience\r\n    record in all classes. Later he played... in Stockholm 67 and as many people\r\n  showed up.” (\r\nVi i tonaren9-6-70) </p>\r\n<p>On June 18,1967 The Experience played \r\n\r\ntheir first American\r\n  concert, at the Monterey Pop Festival in California. They were very successful\r\n  and became a hot act in America as well. July 8,1967, Hendrix and The \r\n\r\nExperience\r\n  began their first US tour, with The Monkees. The tour was a mismatch, because\r\nThe Monkees drew a younger audience (often younger than nine). </p>\r\n<p>On July \r\n\r\n16,1967,\r\n  Hendrix and The Experience played their last date on the tour, because of supposed\r\n  complaints about obscenities by the Daughters of The American Revolution. \r\n\r\nNevertheless,\r\n  Jimi became a sensation world-wide. One Danish newspaper wrote: “1967\r\n  will be remembered...Beatles had to leave the 1st place on the British top-20-charts.\r\n \r\n\r\n First because of Engelbert Humpeldinck....‘Hump was soon expelled by\r\n    Jimi Hendrix. Jimi meant something new to popmusic.”(Vi Unge8-31-67)</p>\r\n<p>In the year of 1966, two \r\n\r\nalbums are released by Jimi Hendrix and The Experience.\r\n    They are: “Are You Experienced” and “Axis: Bold\r\n    as Love”. Jimi toured into the beginning of 1968.<br \r\n\r\n/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>“On the concertfront, the new year will start with nothing less than\r\n  THE JIMI HENDRIX EXPERIENCE....<br />\r\n  The tickets to the...show were sold out in three \r\n\r\ndays. The guitar-dynamo, Hendrix,\r\n    became one of <br />\r\n  the beatworld’s biggest names in 1967...because of his untraditional\r\n    treatment of the guitar and<br />\r\n  \r\n\r\nbecause of those space-sounds he gets from it.”(Politiken1-3-68) <br />\r\n</p>\r\n<p>“ The English critics call Jimi Hendrix, guitarist and vocalist, for\r\n  a genius. The man who \r\n\r\nhas added a new dimension...says ‘I think that\r\n  I would like to run away from it all...and just study music.’”(BT1-4-68) <br />\r\n  </p>\r\n<p>On January 4,1968, Jimi is arrested \r\n\r\nin Gothenburg, Sweden for damaging his\r\n      hotel room. Jimi gave the following interview a few days later: “I\r\n      will perform in Stockholm and on Tuesday I will be back in \r\n\r\nGothenburg to\r\n      clear up this\r\n      incident. Something like this has never happened before....Someone must\r\n      have put some kind of tablet in my glass, otherwise I \r\n\r\nwould never have\r\n      become like that....Everything has gone so fast, I have never had a chance\r\n      to relax....I want peace and quietness and maybe write the pop \r\n\r\nmusical\r\n      I have in mind.”(Expressen1-8-68) <br />\r\n  </p>\r\n<p>As you can tell, Jimi was tired and was beginning to grow weary of touring.\r\n      Unfortunately, his \r\n\r\nmanagers kept booking tours without telling him. The\r\n  album “Electric Ladyland” was released in 1968. Jimi wanted\r\n      a picture of the band on the cover; a controversial one \r\n\r\nwith naked women\r\n  on the cover was released by his managers in order to preserve his image. The\r\n  ploy worked. The following article tells about the wild cover: “ Pop\r\n  \r\n\r\nmusic in England gets wilder and wilder and Jimi Hendrix is the wildest one.\r\n  In the tough world of pop music, in which it gets harder to sell records,\r\n      he releases an LP \r\n\r\nwith a lot of naked bodies on the cover....To advertise\r\n  the record and to ‘electrify the dying pop music’ Jimi\r\n      Hendrix now plays a lot of concerts to promote the new \r\n\r\nstyle.”(Expressen2-11-69) <br />\r\n</p>\r\n<p>In the beginning of 1969, “Jimi Hendrix Experience is one of the world’s\r\n      best playing and paid concertnames of today.” \r\n\r\n(Berlingske Tidende1-8-69) <br />\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Jimi had not lost any of his fame, but he began trying to change his image.\r\n      To his disadvantage, all of his efforts were \r\n\r\nstopped by his management,\r\n  aware the image brought in money. On May 3,1969, Jimi was arrested for possession\r\n  of heroin at the Toronto Airport. He went on trial and was found \r\n\r\nnot guilty\r\n  when a witness said someone put them in Jimi’s bag, Jimi unaware. June\r\n  29,1969, The Experience give their final show together; they were having musical\r\n  \r\n\r\ndifferences\r\nand decided to split up.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n  <strong><em>AFTER THE EXPERIENCE </em></strong></p>\r\n<p>On August 18,1969, Jimi Hendrix and the Gypsy Sons & Rainbows \r\n\r\nBand headlined\r\n  Woodstock. Jimi Hendrix got paid $32,000 for Woodstock while all of the other\r\n  performers got $15,000. Hendrix was to be the finale of Woodstock. His \r\n\r\ncontract\r\n  said no one could follow him. At around 9am, Jimi launched into the national\r\n  anthem- <br />\r\n  a moment which would go into the history of rock and roll. After \r\n\r\nWoodstock,\r\n  Jimi forms The Band of Gypsys and goes on tour. “\r\n  Jimi Hendrix is now so avant-garde that he plays above most popheads. It was\r\n  hard to follow when \r\n\r\nthe...guitar and improvisations go where only Jimi is.\r\n  His style has been copied by thousands of more or less equilibristic guitarists.\r\n  But no one has made a meaningful \r\n\r\ncollage of all his glides on the fingerboard.\r\n  One example is...his version of the ‘Starspangled Banner’.”(Goteborgs\r\n  Handels9-1-70) </p>\r\n<p><em><strong><br />\r\n  HIS \r\n\r\nLAST YEAR </strong></em></p>\r\n<p>The Band of Gypsys disbanded early in 1970. In March, Mitch Mitchell returned\r\n  to Jimi’s group along with Billy Cox,\r\n  a bass player Jimi \r\n\r\nknew from his days in the army; they form the Cry Of Love\r\n  Band. The Cry Of Love Band go on tour for the first part of 1970, and on August\r\n  1 Jimi gave his last performance. \r\n\r\nOn August 26, Jimi’s studio complex,\r\n  The Electric Lady, is opened in New York. Jimi then flew to England, on tour\r\n  there.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong><br />\r\n  HIS DEATH \r\n\r\n</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>The night before his death Jimi stayed at his fiancee’s, Monika Danneman.\r\n  They got home at 8:15pm and had dinner with wine. They discussed their \r\n\r\nplans\r\n  to marry, and Jimi wrote a poem to Monika before she took him to a party at\r\n  1:15am. At 3:00am, Monika went to pick him up, when he came out he emptied\r\n  his pockets \r\n\r\nand showed her all of the drugs people had tried to give him. They\r\n  came home, talked for several hours and than Monika fell asleep. Jimi had a\r\n  hectic day ahead of him, so he \r\n\r\ntook nine Vesperax pills (the average dose was\r\n  a half pill, but Jimi had taken two a few days prior to this and it took over\r\n  an hour to take effect). Monika woke up the next \r\n\r\nday and Jimi was sleeping.\r\n  Later, Jimi was on his side, and she noticed a trickle of fluid coming out\r\n  of his mouth- he was still alive though. She called the ambulance and \r\n\r\nit arrived\r\n  at 11:27am; they took Jimi to the ambulance, put him on his back, and went\r\n  to the Mary Abbots Hospital. Jimi arrived at the hospital at 11:45am, and was\r\n  \r\n\r\npronounced dead at 12:45pm. Private funeral services were held September 31,1970,\r\n  at the Dunlap Baptist Church with the Rev. Blackburn performing the ceremony.\r\n  Jimi is \r\n\r\nburied in Greenwood Cemetery in Renton Washington. The following article\r\n  was wrote about his death: “\r\n  Jimi Hendrix is dead. That’s only four words, but their pretty \r\n\r\nheavy.\r\n  Twenty-seven years old, he had a lot in front of him....It’s not easy\r\n  creating...Listen to the Redding-Hendrix Monterey LP...dig him talking to the\r\n  people. That \r\n\r\nwas his first big gig in the US- he was established in England,\r\n  but hardly heard of here. He puts himself down and at times almost pleads with\r\n  the audience. Later he \r\n\r\nwould...walk off-stage when there were equipment hassles....But\r\n  it wasn’t just an ego trip- he really cared about getting\r\n  the right sound....His guitar and life style have \r\n\r\nleft a permanent dent on\r\n  rock music. He was here for awhile, he changed the heads of anybody who ever\r\ntripped with him...and now he’s gone for awhile.”(Circus Magazine12-70)\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n  <em><strong>MISCONCEPTIONS </strong></em></p>\r\n<p>  <em>1. Jimi was a drug addict.</em><br />\r\n  Jimi never used any hard drugs. Jimi only used marijuana, \r\n\r\nalcohol, cigarettes,\r\n    and only experimented with LSD a few times. “If Jimi is to be called\r\n  a drug addict, then everyone who drinks alcohol is an alcoholic” (Monika\r\n  \r\n\r\nDanneman).</p>\r\n<p>  <em>2. “Purple Haze” was wrote about drugs.</em><br />\r\n  This is completely false. He wrote it about a dream. He was walking under the\r\n    sea, surrounded \r\n\r\nby purple haze. He became lost and Jesus saved him . The\r\n    song was originally called “Purple Haze-Jesus saves.”</p>\r\n<p>  <em>3. Jimi died of a heroin overdose. </em><br \r\n\r\n/>\r\n  Jimi died of suffocation due to the inhalation of vomit. He had no heroin needle\r\n    marks-the marks of a heroin user never leave.</p>\r\n<p>  <em>4. Jimi committed \r\n\r\nsuicide.</em><br />\r\n  Jimi took 9 vesperax pills. Several doctors have confirmed that it was not\r\n    a lethal amount. There were 45 pills in the packet; if he was to commit \r\n\r\nsuicide,\r\n    he would have taken more than 9.</p>\r\n<p>  <em><strong>HIS IMPACT </strong></em></p>\r\n<p>Jimi Hendrix was without a doubt one of the most original, most inspired \r\n\r\nartists\r\n  who ever lived. but Jimi felt people did not understand him, Jimi was not granted\r\n  enough time to alter the skillfully manipulated image which had been thrust\r\n  \r\n\r\nupon him by his management. Jimi was very a very spiritual person. He sometimes\r\n  referred to his music as “sky church music,” because he felt music\r\n  could unite people by \r\n\r\ndrawing them towards the spiritual world and God . Jimi\r\n  was not a missionary though; he was a poet with a mission. “To this day,\r\n  Jimi Hendrix is considered one of rock’s\r\n \r\n\r\n greatest guitarists. His innovations may, in fact, have not been equaled...\r\n  Hendrix was a brilliant songwriter, penning one classic after another. His\r\n  influence can be felt \r\n\r\nthroughout rock, from metal to alternative’”(Addicted\r\n  to Noise). “\r\n  Jimi Hendrix was the most influential and most imitated guitarist of rock’n’roll,\r\n  harnessing \r\n\r\ndistortion and feedback and adopting a psychedelic image that defined\r\n  the ‘60’s”. </p>\r\n<p>As of today, Jimi\r\n  has three songs in the Hall of Fame: ‘Purple Haze,’’All \r\n\r\nAlong\r\n  The Watchtower,’ and ‘\r\n  Voodoo Child’(Slight Return). “As for radical innovators in the\r\n  history of African-American music, the amazing Jimi Hendrix deserves a \r\n\r\nunique\r\n  place. He re-invented the electric guitar, no-one who has played it since has\r\n  been unmoved. In a few short years, he had converted guitar solos mired in\r\n  the \r\n\r\nblues and the comparatively undisciplined rock playing into a domineering,\r\n  aggressive, controlling lead sound. His use of devices such as the wah-wah\r\n  pedal have \r\n\r\nvirtually\r\n  prohibited their use except to imitate Jimi himself, so complete was his dominance.\r\n  No rock player today plays without his influence....Hendrix’s was a new\r\n  \r\n\r\nidea, something spiritual that radiated not only over his guitar, but over\r\n  all instruments. The new electrifying aggressiveness of sound stems from Hendrix\r\n  and concerns not \r\n\r\nonly all guitarists who follow him. It also concerns, for\r\n  example, the best electric pianists in contemporary jazz; it even concerns\r\n  the horn men who use electronics--\r\n\r\ninsofar as they use them more imaginatively\r\n  than merely for “effect.”(African American Baseline\r\n  Essay) Jimi is constantly being rediscovered by new generations. Over 60% \r\n\r\nof\r\n  Hendrix’s\r\n  fans are 21 or younger. Over 2 million records of Jimi have been sold in each\r\n  year after his death. Even today, Jimi still performs. Not live, but by \r\n\r\nvirtual\r\n  reality. “The\r\n  first time I heard Jimi Hendrix, he made me forget everyone else. He somehow\r\n  reinvented every musical sound that came before him. Nobody in the \r\n\r\nworld has\r\n  played the guitar like that since...”(USA Today\r\n  94) There have even been days set in his honor: “Jimi Hendrix, pioneering\r\n  guitarist, of the 1960’s...Jimi \r\n\r\nHendrix...continues to be mourned by\r\n  music lovers everywhere.</p>', '<LI>Fender Stratocaster</LI>', 'www.jimi-hendrix.com', 'All Along the Watchtower', 'Author Unknown', ' June  \r\n\r\n10, 2002  @  1:04 PM', 1),

Metallica\'s then road manager,\r\n  Mark Whittaker, once managed Kirk\'s band Exodus. When it became \r\n\r\ntime to switch\r\n  lead players, Mark was quick to suggest Kirk. </p>\r\n<p>Hammett\'s playing brought Metallica into an era of more melodic and controlled\r\n  guitar work. He\'s \r\n\r\nbeen in the band ever since that day in 1983, which surprisingly\r\n  was less then a month after he and his former band, Exodus opened for Metallica. </p>\r\n<p>Kirk grew up in the \r\n\r\nBay area town of El Sobrante and began playing guitar\r\n  at age 15. His first guitar was a Montgomery Ward catalog special and his first\r\n  amp a shoe box with a 4 inch speaker. A \r\n\r\nfew years later Kirk \"graduated\" to\r\n  a 1978 Fender Stratocaster. Always searching for his sound, Kirk managed to \"Frankenstein\" the\r\n  guitar with different pick up and amp \r\n\r\ncombinations. Eventually he traded up\r\n  to a 1974 Gibson Flying V (just like Michael Schenker\'s!) That Flying V is\r\n  still part of Kirk\'s collection, and still pops up on \r\n\r\nMetallica\'s albums. </p>\r\n<p>With his new Flying V, Kirk started playing with other people. This led to\r\n  a whole other problem: money. A short stint working at Burger King \r\n\r\nfixed that\r\n  as it earned him enough cash to buy his first Marshall amp. Around that time,\r\n  Kirk co-founded Exodus with Paul Baloff. They were the support act for Metallica\r\n \r\n\r\n twice: on November 29, 1982 and March 5, 1983. </p>\r\n<p>After the call from Metallica, Kirk scraped up enough money for a flight to\r\n  the east coast. He found himself outside \r\n\r\nhis native California for the first\r\n  time, on the other side of the country and in a new band. Oddly enough, the\r\n  band never really asked Kirk to join, it wasn\'t until the \r\n\r\nrecording of Kill\r\n  \'Em All that he felt confident he was in. After Kill \'Em All and the tour that\r\n  followed, he took lessons from Joe Satriani and learned the virtues of \r\n\r\njazz,\r\n  blues, classical and Hendrix. </p>\r\n<p>Currently, Kirk can be found in the Bay area, with his wife Lani and dog Darla. <br>\r\n</p>\r\n', '<li>ESP</li>', 'www.metallica.com', 'Call of Cthulu', 'Christian Theves 1998', ' June  10, 2002  @  1:04 PM', 1),

By age ten he knew he could dedicate those hands to playing guitar. Jason\r\nlearned classical from \r\n\r\nhis father and blues from his uncle. At 17 he recorded\r\nhis first album, Speed Metal Symphony, a collaboration with Marty Friedman. They\r\ncalled their band Cacophony, and like all \r\n\r\nMike Varney productions, the record\r\nfeatured relentless speedy guitar playing. The next three years saw a second\r\nCacophony album, Go Off, and a Becker solo album, Perpetual \r\n\r\nBurn.\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\nThen, at age 20, Becker got the best and worst news of his life. After hearing\r\na cornposite tape and a short live audition, David Lee Roth asked Becker to \r\n\r\njoin\r\nhis band, which in 1990 may have been the most coveted gig in hard rock. Roth\r\nwas looking for someone who could handle the parts once played by Eddie Van Halen\r\nand Steve \r\n\r\nVai as well as speak in his own voice. But then fate stepped in. What\r\nbegan as sluggishness in Becker\'s leg was soon diagnosed as Amyotrophic Lateral\r\nSclerosis (ALS, or Lou \r\n\r\nGehrig\'s Disease), a degenerative muscle condition. Even\r\nas Jason finished up his work on Roth\'s A Little Ain\'t Enough, he could feel\r\nthe strength in his hands leaving him. \r\n\r\nOver the next few years his arms and legs\r\nprogressively failed him. But despite a bedridden hody and increasing difficulty\r\nspeaking, Jason\'s inexhaustible spirit and \r\n\r\nimagination have allowed him to explore\r\nthe far reaches of music.\r\n<p></p>\r\nToday Becker is not unlike a musical Stephen Hawking, and the latest discoveries\r\nin his universe \r\n\r\ncan be heard on his newly completed album Perspective. With the\r\nassistance of engineers Danny Alvarez and Mike Bemesderfer, Jason painstakingly\r\ncomposed and recorded the music \r\n\r\nhe heard in his head using a Macintosh computer\r\nrunning Opcode Vision software and sounds from an EMu Proteus module. Bemesderfer\r\nand Alvarez kept some original sounds and \r\n\r\nreplaced others with Synclavier, Kurzweil\r\nK2000, Yamaha SY99, and Korg Wavestation patches and tracks from live musicians\r\nsuch as former Journey vocalist Steve Perry, Alice \r\n\r\nCooper/Lou Reed vet Steve\r\nHunter, string-bender extraordinaire Michael Lee Firkins, and Matt and Greg Bissonette,\r\nthe sometime rhythm section for Roth and Joe Satriani. The \r\n\r\nalbum also features\r\ndigitally revitalized versions of older Becker tracks, so even though Jason cannot\r\npresently play, the record resounds with is fluent guitar work. \"Rain,\" \r\n\r\nfor\r\nexample, incorporates tracks Jason once recorded just for fun using a Carvin\r\nguitar and a Scholz Rockman amp. Perspective was clearly intluenced by Jason\'s\r\nfondness for \r\n\r\nmovie soundtracks. \"I love the way they can yank certain emotions\r\nfrom you, even if the scene in the movie isn\'t that good,\" he explains. \"Some\r\nof my favorite soundtracks are \r\n\r\nThe Black Stallion, Jaws, Edward Scissorhands,\r\nThe Natural, The Last Temptation Of Christ, Batman, The Good, The Bad & The\r\nUgly, A Fistful Of Dollars, For A Few Dollars More, \r\n\r\nAmadeus, and Mishima \' From\r\nthe African/Middle Eastem chants and drums of \"Primal\" and the Japanese-\r\ninfluenced march of \"Empire\" to the Albert King-flavored \"Meet\r\nMe In Yhe \r\n\r\nMorning\" and the quasi-classical flourishes of \"End Of The\r\nBeginning,\" all this diverse music on Perspective has one source: Jason\'s\r\nseemingly limitless spirit.\r\n<p>Becker \r\n\r\nsays he is already planning his next record. \"It won\'t be easy\r\n  to do because of my poor weak body,\" he admits. \"My mind is going\r\n  100 miles per hour with ideas, but my body \r\n\r\ncan only go a half-mile per hour.\r\n  I\'m having a hard time adjusting to this, but somehow something will happen.\r\n  The new music I have in my head is about 60% done. But I \r\n\r\ndon\'t have perfect\r\n  pitch, so I have to learn it. As I learn it, I might mess up in a good way,\r\n  or get off in another direction.\" Whether he wishes it or not, Jason\'s\r\n  \r\n\r\nwill to overcome his physical roadblocks will make him a positive role model\r\n  for guitar players of all stripes. What does he feel other musicians might\r\n  learn from his \r\n\r\nexperience\'? \"I don\'t feel like a role model,\" he\r\n  replies. \"But if I influence people in any way, I would love it if somehow\r\n  I steered them away from judgment and hatred \r\n\r\nand more toward love, peace, and\r\n  creativity.

Shortly\r\n  before\r\n  the album was due to be \r\n\r\nreleased, Staley\'s body was found dead in his apartment.\r\n  Degradation Trip was released the following month. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><hr><br />\r\n\r\nFrom the lyrically and \r\n\r\nsonically mournful “Psychotic Break” to when\r\nthe mental and musical exorcism of Jerry Cantrell\'s nearly 73-minute aural Degradation\r\nTrip concludes with the lovely, somnolent, \r\n\r\nbluesy strains of “Gone,” the\r\nsinger/guitarist\'s Roadrunner debut is a sundry and sometimes scary journey to\r\nthe center of a psyche. It may not always be a pretty trip, but \r\n\r\nit\'s a close-to-the-bone\r\nexcursion that haunts both its creator and its listeners.\r\n<p>As the multi-faceted artist relates, “In \'98, I locked myself in my\r\n  house, went out \r\n\r\nof my mind and wrote 25 songs,” says the then-fully-bearded\r\n  Cantrell. “I rarely bathed during that period of writing, I sent out\r\n  for food, I didn\'t really venture out of my \r\n\r\nhouse in three or four months.\r\n  It was a hell of an experience. The album is an overview of birth to now. That\'s\r\n  all,” he grins, though the visceral and haunting songs, by \r\n\r\nturns soaring\r\n  and raw, do reflect that often-naked and sometimes-grim truth. “Boggy\r\n  Depot [his 1998 solo bow] is like Kindergarten compared to this,” he\r\n  furthers. “The \r\n\r\nmassive sonic growth from Boggy Depot to Degradation Trip\r\n  is comparable to the difference between our work in the Alice In Chains albums\r\n  Facelift to Dirt, which was also a \r\n\r\ntremendous leap.”</p>\r\n<p>And all of Cantrell\'s 25 prolifically penned songs will see the light of day\r\n  by 2002. Degradation Trip, which will be released June 18, is comprised \r\n\r\nof\r\n  14 songs from the personal, transcendent writing marathon that inspired such\r\n  self-searching cuts as “Bargain Basement Howard Hughes,” “Hellbound,” and “Profalse\r\n  \r\n\r\nIdol.” The second batch of songs—“as sad and brutal as Degradation\r\n  Trip” —Cantrell promises, are due out on Roadrunner 2002. Given\r\n  Cantrell\'s introspective, on-the-edge \r\n\r\nmindset, it\'s no surprise then, that\r\n  the melodic, ultra-heavy riff rocker “Anger Rising,” is Degradation\r\n  Trip\'s first single and video. Or those songs like “Mother\'s \r\n\r\nSpinning\r\n  in Her Grave (Glass Dick Jones)” and “Solitude,” (which contains\r\n  the lyrics which gives the album its title) are pointed, pained and forceful.\r\n  Yet there\'s the \r\n\r\nsofter side to the often wry and sarcastic singer/songwriter/guitarist,\r\n  evinced by Cantrell in the romantic “She Was My Girl,” and the\r\n  unforgettable chorus of the wistful \r\n\r\n“Angel Eyes.” A more countrified\r\n  vibe runs through the acoustic-influenced toe-tapper “Give It A Name,” which\r\n  also boasts beautiful, angelic vocals. </p>\r\n<p>Though \r\n\r\nCantrell prefers to remain mum on how autobiographical any of his songs\r\n  might be, it\'s clear that the writer of such Alice In Chains hits as “Rooster,” “Them\r\n  Bones,” and \r\n\r\n“Would?” certainly composes whereof he knows,\r\n  and his pain and experience bleeds through on Degradation Trip. The literate,\r\n  visual lyrics match the edgy, soaring and layered \r\n\r\nmusicality, provided on the\r\n  disc by bassist Robert Trujillo (Suicidal Tendencies, Ozzy Osbourne) and drummer\r\n  Mike Bordin (Faith No More, Ozzy Osbourne), who may tour with \r\n\r\nCantrell when\r\n  not otherwise occupied with Osbourne, with another guitarist also added to\r\n  that mix. </p>\r\n<p>Cantrell\'s current touring band consists of members \r\n\r\nfromAtlanta lineup Comes\r\n  With the Fall, friends and former tour openers. While ex-Queensryche guitarist\r\n  Chris DeGarmo plays on “Anger Rising,” and Cantrell himself can\r\n  \r\n\r\nbe found onstage guesting with bands and friends ranging from Stone Temple\r\n  Pilots to labelmates Nickelback to Metallica, Cantrell preferred to buck the\r\n  trend of making \r\n\r\nDegradation Trip a guest-heavy all-star album.</p>\r\n<p>With a wildly successful show at the 2002 SXSW conference in Austin giving\r\n  a preview of what\'s to come, it will \r\n\r\ncertainly be a joy for Cantrell to have\r\n  the dark musings on Degradation Trip see the light of day on tour. Given its\r\n  purging power, the CD should have provided its creator \r\n\r\nwith catharsis shortly\r\n  after its completion. </p>\r\n<p>But Cantrell\'s emotional liberation is just coming with the CD\'s 2002 release. “\'Psychotic\r\n  Break\' is a great \r\n\r\nplace to start the album, because that\'s where I was at the\r\n  time,” relates Cantrell of the last few years before and during Degradation\r\n  Trip\'s completion at several Los \r\n\r\nAngeles-area studios, including the legendary\r\n  A&M, with co-producer/engineer/mixer Jeff Tomei. “Writing these songs,\r\n  I was about ready to lose my mind. It\'s a lot for any \r\n\r\nperson to exist in this\r\n  business anyway....” Cantrell begins. “But I was writing this record\r\n  to be released by my former label, and we didn\'t see eye to eye in the \r\n\r\nmiddle\r\n  of the process. They pulled the funding, and I mortgaged my house to continue\r\n  on. And I produced it myself to boot. It was a tough time to have it go on,\r\n  but I \r\n\r\nwas focused fully on making a record. I didn\'t even have a manager at\r\n  the time. It\'s something I don\'t want to do again, but I\'m proud I did it and\r\n  it all worked out.” \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>What Cantrell needed, and found in Roadrunner, was “a company with balls\r\n  enough to deal with me and my music. There\'s a lot of milque-toast crap that\r\n  is really \r\n\r\nsuccessful. It was such a massive project - 25 songs, two discs,\r\n  for my debut on a new label. Roadrunner, though, agreed with my commitment\r\n  and that this was essentially a \r\n\r\ndouble album released in two parts.” </p>\r\n<p>Cantrell, who sold 11 million albums with Alice In Chains, has come into his\r\n  own as a solo artist on Degradation Trip, though \r\n\r\nhe\'s still a part of and happy\r\n  to connect himself with the band he formed in the early halcyon days of the\r\n  \'Seattle Scene.\' “I didn\'t associate myself with Alice on \r\n\r\nBoggy Depot,” he\r\n  recalls. “I was stepping away from the band, so there was a consciousness\r\n  of not sounding like Alice. But people\'s awareness fades,” he realizes. “An\r\n  \r\n\r\nAlice fan would know my name, but some guy who just likes the Alice tunes may\r\n  not know me. I found that when people saw the Alice In Chains MTV Unplugged\r\n  show, they realized \r\n\r\nhow much I sang, and how many of the songs I\'d written\r\n  in Alice. I realized how much Alice was and is a part of me and how proud I\r\n  am of that band. And with Degradation \r\n\r\nTrip, you know who it is when you listen\r\n  to the record,” Cantrell acknowledges. </p>\r\n<p>“I\'ve had people say, \'it sounds so much like Alice,\'” which,\r\n  of course, is a \r\n\r\nnice complement, as well as a given. That said, “it\'s\r\n  completely different being a full-time lead singer. A lot more pressure,” he\r\n  admits. “I loved what I did on Boggy \r\n\r\nDepot, but I\'m growing, I\'m much\r\n  more confident and you can tell, vocally. You can hear the growth between the\r\n  two records. I think it was because of all the shit I was \r\n\r\ngoing through, I\r\n  was so fucking angry, and I had a lot of emotions that weren\'t very pretty,\r\n  and it came out of me on this record.”</p>\r\n<p>He kept that edge from start \r\n\r\nto finish, beginning with the demo process in\r\n  his Seattle-area home, where the tunes were laid down on a four-track, all\r\n  on the same guitar, “It\'s my white guitar with all \r\n\r\nthe burn marks on\r\n  it, my Gibson Les Paul. I actually broke the headstock off halfway through\r\n  the writing, but somehow it stayed in tune! I didn\'t record the demos very\r\n  \r\n\r\nwell, just guitar lines and vocals, because sometimes you lose the magic when\r\n  you try to re-record it. So I get it workable, to where there\'s still stuff\r\n  to be explored. \r\n\r\nAnd Mike and Robert were big sticklers on me to staying true\r\n  to the demos. I gave them a lot of respect, and they gave it back. I was real\r\n  touched by them. They went through \r\n\r\nit all with me. They bled for it just as\r\n  much as I did, and it all comes out on the record. This record was a hard,\r\n  dark journey,” concludes Cantrell. </p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n“Degradation Trip is an apt title. There\'s nothing better to describe\r\n  the songs and experience than that phrase. I think you gotta be a little bit\r\n  crazy to do this. And the \r\n\r\nguys who are usually really crazy are usually the\r\n  better ones. It\'s a fine line to walk.” And as the dark, dangerous beauty\r\n  that is Degradation Trip makes very clear, no \r\n\r\none does a better job of teetering\r\n  on that edge than Cantrell.', '<li>Guild Acoustic Guitars</li>', 'www.jerrycantrell.com', 'Got Me Wrong', 'www.jerrycantrell.com | VH1 Artists \r\n\r\nDirectory', ' April  05, 2002  @  4:01 AM', 3);

Which perhaps explains why, as Adrian says, \"there\'s almost\r\n  a telepathy that exists between me and Dave, it\'s so spot on, it\'s uncanny.\r\n  We\r\n  just always know \r\n\r\nwhat the other one is about to do when we\'re playing.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>In short, Adrian and Dave would become the perfect foil with which to make\r\n  the trademark twin-lead guitar \r\n\r\nsound of Maiden back then work to its utmost\r\n  potential. Then, as the years passed and each new Maiden album somehow managed\r\n  to surpass the last, Adrian began revealing his \r\n\r\ntalents as a songwriter, too,\r\n  co-authoring, most often with singer Bruce Dickinson, but also with bassist\r\n  Steve Harris and Dave, too, and eventually on his own, some of the \r\n\r\nbest-remembered\r\n  Maiden hits from the \'80s. \'2 Minutes To Midnight\', \'Wasted Years\', \'Stranger\r\n  In A Strange Land\', \'Can I Play With Madness\', \'The Evil That Men \r\n\r\nDo\'...the\r\n  list of songs that began life as what Adrian calls \"these little bits\r\n  and pieces I come up with\" is long and impressive. - As Steve says: \"There\'s\r\n  no \r\n\r\ndoubting Adrian\'s talent, he even sings pretty well! And to have someone\r\n  like him in the band really helped us come up with some interesting new ideas.\r\n  He\'s so versatile, \r\n\r\nwe were able to do things with Adrian we\'d never been able\r\n  to do before.</p>\r\n<p>Or as Adrian himself says: \"The great thing about writing for Maiden\r\n  is that the band has \r\n\r\nsuch a strong musical identity, you\'re always starting\r\n  from a really good place. Like, if you fancy writing a fast one - well, there\'s\r\n  no better band in the world for \r\n\r\nplaying fast numbers!</p>\r\n<p>\"Same with the slower, or more progressive type of things - again, there\'s\r\n  no better band to take you into some strange musical places than \r\n\r\nMaiden. It\'s\r\n  such an inspirational band to write for because it can do anything. And Steve\r\n  would always encourage you to use your imagination and come up with something\r\n \r\n\r\n different from the usual 4/4 beat thing most rock bands do all the time.\"</p>\r\n<p>And yet, strange to relate, it so nearly didn\'t happen. Adrian had actually\r\n  been offered the \r\n\r\njob in Maiden prior to the band going in to record their first\r\n  eponymously-titled album, in January 1980, but had politely declined. A decision\r\n  he quickly came to regret as \r\n\r\nthe first Maiden album rocketed into the UK charts\r\n  at No.4 just a few months later.</p>\r\n<p>But then, as Adrian says: \"I\'ve never done anything just for the money.\r\n  So I \r\n\r\ndidn\'t regret it, really. I had my own band, Urchin, that I was still\r\n  trying to get off the ground, and I think Steve respected that.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"I suppose it was a bit like me \r\n\r\nwith Maiden,\" says Steve, \"Adrian\r\n  had had Urchin going since he was at school and he rightly wanted to stick\r\n  with it. I thought, fair enough, good luck to ya, mate! Then \r\n\r\nwhen we came back\r\n  to him a year later, he was tempted I think \'cos he liked the band, he was\r\n  a big mate of Davey\'s and Urchin was over by then anyway. And when he \r\n\r\nfinally\r\n  made up his mind to go for it with Maiden, he slotted in really quick.\"</p>\r\n<p>Adrian was born in Hackney, east London, on February 27, 1957. The son of\r\n  a painter \r\n\r\nand decorator, and the youngest child of three, he had what he describes\r\n  now as \"a typically happy, pretty boring upbringing, I suppose.\"</p>\r\n<p>A Manchester United football \r\n\r\nfan who later replaced the pictures on his bedroom\r\n  wall of Georgie Best and Bobby Charlton with posters of Jimi Hendrix and Ritchie\r\n  Blackmore, Adrian was 15 when he bought \r\n\r\nhis first album: Deep Purple\'s \'Machine\r\n  Head\'. There was no looking back after that.</p>\r\n<p>\"My sister used to go out with this guy and she used to borrow his records\r\n  \r\n\r\nand leave them lying round the house. Stuff like Purple, Free, Black Sabbath...Then\r\n  she stopped going out with him, so I started buying the records myself.\"</p>\r\n<p>Dave Murray \r\n\r\nwas the only other person he knew, he says, \"that was into\r\n  the same sort of thing as me.\" It was Dave who first encouraged Adrian\r\n  to take up the guitar. \"I noticed that \r\n\r\nwhenever Dave brought his guitar\r\n  to school he used to be surrounded by girls!\" he chuckles. Soon the two\r\n  were playing regularly together and had decided to form a band. So \r\n\r\nconvinced\r\n  was he of his destiny that Adrian left school at 16 without even bothering\r\n  to take his O-level exams.</p>\r\n<p>\"I thought, I\'m going to be a rock star - I don\'t \r\n\r\nneed all this!\" he\r\n  guffaws, before adding with a sad shake of his head: \"It all seems so\r\n  simple when you\'re still at school.\" - He was in for a rude awakening\r\n  and \r\n\r\nwhile he was \"waiting for something to happen\" the would-be rock\r\n  star worked a series of dead-end jobs: trainee spot-welder, apprentice cabinet\r\n  maker, milkman...\"I used to \r\n\r\njust lurk about until they got rid of me or\r\n  I\'d had enough and left - usually when there was a gig coming up.\"</p>\r\n<p>The band he and Dave formed - Evil Ways - had now \r\n\r\nmetamorphosed into Urchin. \"Dave\r\n  used to come and go,\" Adrian recalls. \"Playing with me and then Maiden\r\n  and then me again, then back to Maiden...\"</p>\r\n<p>Looking back, he \r\n\r\nsays \"it was probably only a matter of time before I\r\n  hooked up with Dave again.\" Fortunately for Adrian - and for his many\r\n  fans - the band he did finally hook up with Dave \r\n\r\nagain in was Iron Maiden.</p>\r\n<p>The rest, as they say, is history. The six studio albums Adrian recorded with\r\n  Maiden in the \'80s are still regarded as one of the most \r\n\r\nfertile - not to mention,\r\n  successful - periods in the band\'s career.</p>\r\n<p>When he left the band, in 1990, to pursue a solo career, despite some excellent\r\n  recordings, \r\n\r\nhe admits now that, \"it felt strange not being in the band\r\n  any more. It had become a way of life for me and I realised how much Maiden\r\n  will always be a part of me, and how \r\n\r\nmuch I missed it.\"</p>\r\n<p>The feeling, one suspected and knows now, was entirely mutual...</p>\r\n', '<li>Fender Stratocaster</li>', 'www.ironmaiden.com', 'Aces High', 'Iron Maiden \r\n\r\nLyrics Sanctuary', ' June  10, 2002  @  1:04 PM', 2),

Indeed,\r\n  the mile-wide smile apart, \r\n\r\noff stage, he is almost unrecognisable from the blonde-haired\r\n  rock god we get to see on stage with Iron Maiden. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  \"\r\n  Oh, well, you can\'t walk down the \r\n\r\nstreet throwing shapes like you do on stage,\" he\r\n  says with one those dazzling and frequent smiles. \"I mean, you\'d just\r\n  look silly!\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>But it goes deeper than \r\n\r\nthat. Along with the warmth and generosity and the\r\n  general down-to-earth-ness, not to mention the musical talent, Dave Murray\r\n  possesses a quality so rare in rock star \r\n\r\ncircles as to be almost non-existent:\r\n  humbleness.</p>\r\n<p>\"It\'s my upbringing,\" he shrugs, not wanting to make a big thing\r\n  of it. \"When you start out with nothing, you \r\n\r\ndon\'t expect much from life.\r\n  For all this to happen to me - well, it\'s like a dream, really,\" he says,\r\n  pausing to gaze, as if for the first time, at the gold records that \r\n\r\nadorn every\r\n  wall in the office where we sit. </p>\r\n<p>David Michael Murray was born, of mixed Scots and Irish descent, in Edmunton,\r\n  London, on December 23, 1956. Like \r\n\r\nSteve Harris, who had been born the same\r\n  year just a few miles up the road, as a boy Dave was a fanatical football player\r\n  and fan, as well as a keen cricketer. But his \r\n\r\nfamily was poor - his father\r\n  was disabled and his mother worked part- time as a cleaner - and the family\r\n  never settled anywhere long enough for Dave to establish himself in \r\n\r\nany of\r\n  the schools\' teams he could have played for. By his reckoning, he had been\r\n  to a dozen different schools by the time he left for good at the age of 15.</p>\r\n<p>\"It \r\n\r\nwas tough but it was only looking back on it years later that I realised\r\n  just how tough,\" he says now. \"But then, maybe I wouldn\'t appreciate\r\n  what I\'ve got now so much, if \r\n\r\nit hadn\'t been for then.\" </p>\r\n<p>These days, when he\'s not touring and recording with Maiden, Dave lives on\r\n  the exotic Hawaiian island of Maui with his Californian-born \r\n\r\nwife, Tamar, and\r\n  their beautiful eight-year-old daughter, Tasha. But, he says, \"Not a day\r\n  goes by that I don\'t think, \'When is this going to end?\' It\'s like it\'s \r\n\r\nall\r\n  too good to be true.\"</p>\r\n<p>The first thing he did when he made some money was buy his folks a house.\r\n  His father has since passed away but his mother still lives \r\n\r\nthere to this day.\r\n  The only surviving member of the band - along with Steve Harris - who first\r\n  signed to EMI Records back in 1979, Dave\'s hard upbringing also helped \r\n\r\nhim\r\n  ride the highs and lows of his career in Maiden without ever losing his head.\r\n  As he says, \"I grew a protective shell around me and just got on with\r\n  things. And I \r\n\r\nthink that held me in good stead later with Maiden, especially\r\n  in the early days.\" </p>\r\n<p>Dave first got interested in rock music when he was 15. He\'d heard \'Voodoo\r\n  \r\n\r\nChile (Part 2)\' by Jimi Hendrix on the radio and \"everything changed -\r\n  just like that.\" He had been a skinhead up until then. \"But I just\r\n  ditched the Doc Martens and I got \r\n\r\nmyself an old Afghan coat and became a hippy\r\n  - man!\" he chortles. </p>\r\n<p>He also got himself a guitar and started practising every night in his bedroom. \"I\r\n  didn\'t read \r\n\r\nmusic, I just used to sit and play along to records.\" His\r\n  first band - a school trio called Stone Free - was actually with future fellow\r\n  Maiden guitarist, Adrian Smith, who \r\n\r\nlived a few streets away. \"Dave was\r\n  a little bit further down the road than I was, in terms of playing,\" remembers\r\n  Adrian. \"I was a bit jealous, actually.\" </p>\r\n<p>From \r\n\r\nthere, Dave had played with a number of different bands before meeting\r\n  Steve Harris and joining Iron Maiden for the first time in 1976. As long-time\r\n  Maiden scholars will \r\n\r\nknow, he was actually sacked just a few months later -\r\n  after a spat with then vocalist Dennis Wilcock - and that, for a while, Dave\r\n  rejoined Adrian in Urchin, who recorded \r\n\r\none single, \'Black Leather Jacket\',\r\n  before Dave upped sticks again and returned to a now thankfully Wilcock-free\r\n  Maiden.</p>\r\n<p>\"I never wanted Davey to leave in the \r\n\r\nfirst place,\" says Steve today. \"I\r\n  always thought he was the best guitarist I\'d ever worked with. He was one of\r\n  those guys who really could play the guitar with his teeth, \r\n\r\nyou know?\" </p>\r\n<p>Musically, Dave\'s contributions to Maiden over the years have mainly been\r\n  of the \'scintillating guitar solo\' variety - witness any of his sublime \r\n\r\nwork\r\n  from early Blackmore-esque outbursts like the solo on \'Phantom of The Opera\'\r\n  (from 1980\'s \'Iron Maiden\') to more recent peaks of performance like the eye-\r\n\r\nwatering\r\n  solo on \'Lightning Strikes Twice\' (from last year\'s \'Virtual XI\').</p>\r\n<p>That said, despite a strike rate that works out to about one song per album\r\n  - a \r\n\r\ntrait he puts down to his own \"laidback\" nature more than anything\r\n  - Davey is a talented songwriter, too. From the witty and wonderfully ludicrous\r\n  \'Charlotte The Harlot\' \r\n\r\n(from \'Iron Maiden\'), to more thought-provoking stuff\r\n  like the stiflingly atmospheric \'The Prophecy\' (from 1988\'s \'Seventh Son Of\r\n  A Seventh Son\'), more than any other \r\n\r\nmember of Maiden, apart from Steve himself,\r\n  Dave Murray is the living embodiment of the heart and soul of Iron Maiden.</p>\r\n<p>\"I\'m just lucky,\" he says typically modestly. \r\n\r\n\"Lucky that I\r\n  found such a great band to play in, and lucky to have such great fans that\r\n  are into what we\'re doing.\"</p>\r\n<p>But then, that\'s Dave Murray - modest, \r\n\r\nhumble, down-to-earth and about as\r\n  great a rock guitarist as you\'re going to get.</p>\r\n<p>We\'re lucky to have him.</p>\r\n', '<li>Fender Stratocaster</li>', 'www.ironmaiden.com', 'Revelations', 'Iron Maiden Lyrics Sanctuary', ' June  10, 2002  @  7:23 PM', 0),

She later fronted Vaughan\'s most\r\n  successful project, named Double Trouble after an Otis Rush standard, for a\r\n  short period after \r\n\r\nits inception in 1979. The new band also featured drummer\r\n  Chris Layton and ex-Johnny Winter bass player Tommy Shannon. Producer Jerry\r\n  Wexler, an early fan, added them to the \r\n\r\nbill of the 1982 Montreux Jazz Festival,\r\n  where Vaughan was spotted and hired by David Bowie for his forthcoming Let\'s\r\n  Dance (1983). Vaughan turned down Bowie\'s subsequent \r\n\r\nworld tour, however, to\r\n  rejoin his own band and record Texas Flood with veteran producer John Hammond.</p>\r\n<p>Couldn\'t Stand The Weather showed the influence of Jimi Hendrix, \r\n\r\nand earned\r\n  the band its first platinum disc; in February 1985, they picked up a Grammy\r\n  for their contribution to the Blues Explosion anthology. Soul To Soul saw the\r\n  \r\n\r\naddition of keyboards player Reese Wynans; Vaughan, by this point a much sought-after\r\n  guitarist, could also be heard on records by James Brown, Johnny Copeland,\r\n  and his \r\n\r\nmentor, Lonnie Mack. The period of extensive substance abuse that produced\r\n  the lacklustre Live Alive led to Vaughan\'s admittance to a Georgia detoxification\r\n  centre. His \r\n\r\nrecovery was apparent on In Step, which won a second Grammy. In\r\n  1990 the Vaughan brothers worked together with Bob Dylan on their own Family\r\n  Style, and as guests on Eric \r\n\r\nClapton\'s American tour. Vaughan died in 1990,\r\n  at East Troy, Wisconsin, USA, when, anxious to return to Chicago after Clapton\'s\r\n  Milwaukee show, he switched helicopter \r\n\r\nseats and boarded a vehicle that crashed,\r\n  in dense fog, into a ski hill. The Sky Is Crying, compiled by Jimmie Vaughan\r\n  from album sessions, was posthumously released the \r\n\r\nfollowing year. Vaughan\r\n  was a magnificent ambassador for the blues, whose posthumous reputation continues\r\n  to increase. Plans to erect an nine-foot bronze statue to the \r\n\r\nguitarist in\r\n  his home-town of Austin went ahead in October 1992. In 2001, Vaughan\'s former\r\n  band Double Trouble (Chris Layton and Tommy Shannon) had considerable \r\n\r\nsuccess\r\non their own with the chart-topping Been A Long Time.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>HE PERFORMED AS HE ALWAYS HAD, as if the song of the moment would be his last.\r\n  During the \r\n\r\nblistering, 20-minute rendition of \"Sweet Home Chicago\" that\r\n  closed the show at the Alpine Valley Music Theater near East Troy, Wisconsin,\r\n  guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan was \r\n\r\nonstage with fellow bluesmen Eric Clapton, Buddy\r\n  Guy, Robert Cray and Vaughan\'s older brother, Jimmie. Said Guy later: \"It\r\n  was one of the most incredible sets I ever heard \r\n\r\nStevie play. I had goose bumps.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  Shortly afterward, at 12:15 A.M. on Aug. 27, the exhilarated musicians left\r\n  the stage through a rear exit. Vaughan, 35, had \r\n\r\nplanned to make the two-hour\r\n  drive\r\n  back to his Chicago hotel with his brother and sister-in-law, Connie, but at\r\n  the last minute he chose to board a Bell 206B Jet \r\n\r\nRanger, one of four helicopters\r\n  waiting nearby. According to his New York City publicist, Charles Comer, Vaughan\r\n  had learned from Clapton\'s manager that there were seats \r\n\r\nenough to accommodate\r\n  all three in his party. When he found only one place was actually available,\r\n  Vaughan said to Connie and Jimmie, \"Do you mind if I take the seat? I\r\n  \r\n\r\nreally need to get back.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  The helicopter took off in fog around 12:40 A.M. with Vaughan and four others\r\n  aboard. Sweet Chicago would never be reached. Moments \r\n\r\nlater the chopper\'s remains\r\n  lay spread across more than 200 feet of a man-made ski slope in a field dotted\r\n  with bittersweet and Queen Anne\'s lace. All on board were killed \r\n\r\ninstantly\r\n  in what National Transportation Safety Board investigator William Bruce later\r\n  described\r\n  as \"a high-energy, high-velocity impact at a shallow angle.\"<br>\r\n  \r\n\r\nFans leaving the noisy concert site did not hear the crash, which occurred on\r\n  the far side of the nearby hill. In fact a search for the lost copter wasn\'t\r\n  begun until 5 \r\n\r\nA.M. -- more than four hours later -- after an orbiting search-and-rescue\r\n  satellite picked up the craft\'s emergency-locator transmitter signal. At 7 A.M.\r\n  searchers found \r\n\r\nthe bodies of Vaughan; Bobby Brooks, Clapton\'s Hollywood agent;\r\n  pilot Jeff Brown (who may have been unfamiliar with the hilly site\'s tricky take-off\r\n  procedures); \r\n\r\nClapton\'s assistant tour manager, Colin Smythe; and Clapton\'s bodyguard,\r\n  Nigel Browne. Later that morning Clapton and Jimmie Vaughan were summoned by\r\n  the Walworth County \r\n\r\ncoroner to identify the bodies.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  The crash stilled the music of a man that many had considered on the lip of true\r\n  stardom. Vaughan\'s last album, In Step, had \r\n\r\ngone gold and won a Grammy, and a\r\n  new LP had already been recorded for release later this month. The latter, titled\r\n  Family Style, was a pet project of Vaughan and brother \r\n\r\nJimmie, 38, who had quit\r\n  his job as lead guitarist with the Fabulous Thunderbirds to work on the LP.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  A promising guitar player by the time he was 8, Stevie Ray \r\n\r\ngrew up in Dallas,\r\n  the son of an asbestos plant worker and a secretary at a ready-mix cement factory.\r\n  He abandoned high school at 17 and, with his brother, began haunting \r\n\r\nthe all-night\r\n  blues clubs of Austin, where his trademark bandito hat, tar-paper voice and potent\r\n  playing became as familiar as the clubs\' watered-down drinks. A videotape \r\n\r\nof\r\n  one performance, sent to Mick Jagger, led to a New York City nightclub appearance\r\n  at Jagger\'s request, but it was Vaughan\'s stunning set at the 1982 Montreux Jazz\r\n  \r\n\r\nFestival that brought him both a record contract and the wider recognition he\r\n  deserved.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  Vaughan had been plagued for years by severe alcohol and drug \r\n\r\ndependency, and\r\n  he chronicled his successful struggle to kick the twin sins with his album\r\n  In Step. \"He just went straight in the last four years,\" says a friend. \"Since\r\n \r\n\r\n then he wouldn\'t even drink tea with caffeine. It\'s such a shame. He was such\r\n  a sweet man.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  Five albums, countless tours and guest appearances -- live and \r\n\r\nin the studio\r\n  -- with a pantheon of blues and rock performers like B.B. King and David Bowie\r\n  had established the goateed musician as one of the reigning kings of his genre. \r\n\r\n\"He\r\n  did a lot for us blues players, keeping the blues happening,\" says guitarist\r\n  Albert Collins, who remembers seeing Vaughan play in Austin\'s bars when the latter\r\n  was \r\n\r\nstill a teenager. \"He was attractive to younger kids, and he always\r\n  had this fire in him. He made the blues a young and old thing to listen to.\" Grammy-winning\r\n  blues singer \r\n\r\nKoko Taylor echoes Collins\'s view. \"People didn\'t pay attention\r\n  to the blues,\" says Taylor. \"Vaughan was one of the musicians who\r\n  changed that.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  Vaughan \r\n\r\nhad bought a home in the Highland Park section of Dallas about nine months\r\n  ago; killed four years to the day after the death of his father, he will now\r\n  be buried nearby. His \r\n\r\ndeath is a sad new addition to a series of similar air-crash\r\n  tragedies that over the years have claimed such stars as Patsy Cline, Buddy Holly,\r\n  Otis Redding, Jim Croce, Rick \r\n\r\nNelson and others. But to Vaughan\'s friends and\r\n  fans, the latest loss is far more than a sad statistic.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  Last summer Vaughan had come to Chicago on another \r\n\r\nmission, to help Buddy Guy,\r\n  whom he had known for a decade, open his new South Side nightclub. Hours before\r\n  the crash the pair teamed up again for the last song Vaughan \r\n\r\nwould ever perform. \"Stevie\r\n  is the best friend I\'ve ever had, the best guitarist I ever heard and the best\r\n  person anyone will ever want to know,\" a choked-up Guy said the \r\n\r\nday after\r\n  his friend\'s death. \"He will be missed a lot.\"</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<p>1954 <br>\r\n  Stephen Ray Vaughan is born October 3 in Dallas, Texas to Jim and Martha \r\n\r\nVaughan.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  1963<br>\r\n  Under the guidance of his brother Jimmie (b. 1951), Stevie Ray begins to play\r\n  the guitar.

(42, '', 'page.jpg', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'Born: January 9, 1944<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBands:\r\n<li>Led Zepplin</li>', 'Stairway To Heaven', 'Heartbreaker', 'No Quarter', 'Unquestionably one of the all-time most influential, important, and versatile\r\nguitarists and songwriters in rock history is Jimmy Page. Just about every \r\n\r\nrock\r\nguitarist from the late \'60s/early \'70s to the present day has been influenced\r\nby Page\'s work with Led Zeppelin his monolithic riffs served as a blueprint for\r\nwhat \r\n\r\nwould eventually become heavy metal, yet he refused to be pigeonholed to\r\nany single musical style (touching upon folk, country, funk, blues, and other\r\ngenres). Page also lent a \r\n\r\nhand in writing (or co-writing) Zeppelin\'s vast array\r\nof classic songs and produced all their albums.\r\n<p>Born on January 9, 1944, in Heston, Middlesex, England, Page picked up \r\n\r\nthe\r\n  guitar at age 13 after being inspired by the Elvis Presley tune \"Baby\r\n  Let\'s Play House,\" and while he took several lessons, was mostly self-taught.\r\n  Instead of \r\n\r\nattending college right after high school, Page decided to join\r\n  his first real rock band, Neil Christian & the Crusaders, whom he toured\r\n  England with. But Page fell \r\n\r\nseriously ill (with glandular fever) and was forced\r\n  to quit and recuperate. Dejected, Page pondered giving up music and focusing\r\n  on another interest, painting, as he \r\n\r\nenrolled at an art college in Sutton,\r\n  Surrey. </p>\r\n<p>With the emergence of such bands as the Rolling Stones in the early \'60s and\r\n  their gritty blues-rock, Page\'s \r\n\r\ninterest in music perked up once again but\r\n  instead of forming a band right away, he decided to hone his craft by becoming\r\n  one of England\'s top session guitarists and \r\n\r\nproducers. Although the exact specifics\r\n  of which sessions he was involved with have become hazy over time, it\'s confirmed\r\n  that he worked with many of the day\'s top acts, \r\n\r\nincluding the Who, Them, Donovan,\r\n  the Kinks, and the Rolling Stones, among others. By 1966, Page was looking\r\n  to put his session work on hold and join a full-time band; he \r\n\r\naccepted an offer\r\n  to play with the Yardbirds (initially as a bassist, then shortly thereafter\r\n  as a guitarist), as he was paired up with another one of rock\'s all-time \r\n\r\nguitar\r\n  greats, Jeff Beck. Although the Yardbirds began as a straight-ahead blues-rock\r\n  band, with the inclusion of Page in the lineup, the group began experimenting\r\n  with \r\n\r\npsychedelic and hard rock styles. </p>\r\n<p>Despite it being obvious that the Yardbirds were on the downside of their\r\n  career (Beck left shortly after Page came onboard), Page \r\n\r\nappeared on the album\r\n  Little Games and several tours before the band finally called it a day in 1968.\r\n  With a string of tour dates still set up throughout Europe, Page \r\n\r\ndecided to\r\n  go through with the shows and put together a new band who was dubbed the New\r\n  Yardbirds including longtime session bassist John Paul Jones, plus newcomers\r\n  \r\n\r\nRobert Plant on vocals and John Bonham on drums. After the completion of their\r\n  initial tour, the band changed their name to Led Zeppelin and explored the\r\n  still largely \r\n\r\nuncharted territory of hard rock/heavy metal. The band immediately\r\n  became one of rock\'s most successful and enduring bands, issuing a string of\r\n  classic albums from 1969 \r\n\r\nthrough 1975 Led Zeppelin I, Led Zeppelin II, Led\r\n  Zeppelin III, Led Zeppelin IV, Houses of the Holy, and Physical Graffiti which\r\n  spawned such classic rock radio standards as \r\n\r\n\"Dazed and Confused,\" \"Whole\r\n  Lotta Love,\" \"Immigrant Song,\" \"Black Dog,\" \"Stairway\r\n  to Heaven,\" and \"Kashmir,\" as the band also became a must-see\r\n  live act in the \r\n\r\nprocess. Page also found the time to work with folk artist\r\n  Roy Harper (most notably his 1971 release, Stormcock, under the alias S. Flavius\r\n  Mercurius). Zeppelin was arguably \r\n\r\nthe biggest rock band in the world by the\r\n  mid-\'70s (their influence on other rock bands following in their wake cannot\r\n  be stressed enough) as they launched their own record \r\n\r\ncompany, Swan Song. </p>\r\n<p>Zeppelin continued issuing albums until the dawn of the \'80s (1976\'s concert\r\n  movie/soundtrack The Song Remains the Same and Presence, 1979\'s In \r\n\r\nThrough\r\n  the Out Door), but tragedy ultimately derailed the quartet with the death of\r\n  Plant\'s young son in 1977 and Bonham\'s death in 1980. After Led Zeppelin decided\r\n  \r\n\r\nto call it quits in late 1980, Page disappeared from sight (it became known\r\n  later on that he hardly touched his instrument for a long time afterward).\r\n  It wasn\'t until 1982 \r\n\r\nthat Page began to emerge from his self-imposed exile,\r\n  as he composed and played on the motion picture soundtrack Death Wish II, compiled\r\n  the Zeppelin outtakes collection, \r\n\r\nCoda, and took part in the 1983 star-studded\r\n  A.R.M.S. tour, which saw Page unite with Beck and Eric Clapton for a series\r\n  of shows that raised money for multiple sclerosis \r\n\r\nresearch. In 1984, Page guested\r\n  alongside Plant, Beck, and Nile Rodgers on the hit EP of rock & roll oldies\r\n  The Honeydrippers, and formed his first band since the demise of \r\n\r\nZeppelin,\r\n  dubbed the Firm. The group featured former Free/Bad Company vocalist Paul Rodgers,\r\n  and despite the fact that their self-titled debut was a sizeable hit, the \r\n\r\nband\r\n  decided to call it a day shortly after the release of their sophomore effort,\r\n  Mean Business. </p>\r\n<p>Zeppelin fans were given a rare treat when their surviving three \r\n\r\nmembers reunited\r\n  (with drummers Tony Thompson and Phil Collins) for the mammoth Live Aid at\r\n  Philadelphia\'s JFK Stadium in July 1985. Zeppelin reunited again in 1988 for\r\n \r\n\r\n the Atlantic Records 25th Anniversary Concert at New York\'s Madison Square\r\n  Garden with John Bonham\'s son, Jason, filling in for his late father behind\r\n  the kit. The same \r\n\r\nyear Page guested on Plant\'s solo release, Now & Zen,\r\n  as well as issuing his first ever solo recording, Outrider, following it up\r\n  with a tour that touched upon tracks from \r\n\r\nall eras of his career. By the early\r\n  \'90s, further rumors of an impending Zeppelin reunion continued to circulate,\r\n  and after Plant declined an invitation from Page to join \r\n\r\nforces once again,\r\n  Page decided to collaborate with former Deep Purple/Whitesnake vocalist David\r\n  Coverdale, whose vocal style has often been compared to Plant\'s over the \r\n\r\nyears.The\r\n  collaboration produced a single album, 1993\'s heavily Zep-like Coverdale/Page,\r\n  while a proposed world tour was scrapped after just a few select dates in Japan. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>In 1994, Plant and Page finally agreed to collaborate once again (although\r\n  Jones wasn\'t invited this time), leading to the release of the mostly acoustic\r\n  set No \r\n\r\nQuarter the same year, plus a highly popular MTV Unplugged special and\r\n  sold-out world tour. A year later, Led Zeppelin was inducted into the Rock & Roll\r\n  Hall of Fame, this \r\n\r\nbeing the second time a Page-related band got the nod from\r\n  the Hall (in 1992, the Yardbirds were honored). 1998 saw Plant and Page issue\r\n  an album of all-new material, \r\n\r\nWalking into Clarksdale. The duo went their separate\r\n  ways by the late \'90s, as Page joined the Black Crowes for a tour and live\r\n  album (2000\'s Live at the Greek). The same \r\n\r\nyear as the album\'s release, another\r\n  Crowes/Page tour was cut short due to a back injury Page suffered. </p>', '<li>Gibson Les Paul</li>', 'index.php', 'Ramble On', 'www.jimmypageonlne.com | Greg Prato\r\n', ' June  10, 2002  @  1:04 PM', 0),

Shortly after graduating\r\nfrom high school, he found himself \r\n\r\nrecording his first album with the group,\r\nwho by this time had changed their name to Testament. What followed were five\r\nalbums and countless tours with, among others, Megadeth, \r\n\r\nSlayer, Judas Priest,\r\nand White Zombie. Alex received critical acclaim for his lead guitar work, which\r\nhad been inspired by heroes such Eddie Van Halen and Randy Rhoads. In the \r\n\r\nmeantime,\r\nhowever, Alex\'s tastes were changing. An exposure to Miles Davis\' electric bands\r\ninspired him to push harder to be a serious musician. No longer content to \r\n\r\nbe\r\njust a metal player, he began an intense study of many types of music including\r\njazz, funk and world music.\r\n<p>In 1990, twenty-one year old Alex was tapped by Guitar World \r\n\r\nmagazine to become\r\n  a monthly instruction columnist.

It was around this time that Alex did his first guitar clinic.\r\n  He has gone on to give guitar clinics across the U.S. and in Europe.

Since leaving Testament in 1992, he has\r\n  blossomed into an \r\n\r\nartist of profound diversity, going on to perform and/or\r\n  record with Primus bassist Les Claypool and drummer Brain (currently of Guns\'n\r\n  Roses), Wyndham Hill recording \r\n\r\nartist Michael Manring, Attention Deficit (w/Michael\r\n  Manring and Primus drummer Tim Alexander), Savatage, Ozzy Osbourne, keyboardist\r\n  Adam Holzman (of Miles Davis), Broadway \r\n\r\nstar Rob Evan (Les Miserables and Jeckyl\r\n  And Hyde) and more. Alex continues to be a featured member of the smash hit\r\n  holiday show Trans-Siberian Orchestra, performing to \r\n\r\nsold out crowds across\r\n  the U.S. as well as appearing in local and national radio and television appearances.\r\n  He has also become active as a composer; with credits including \r\n\r\npieces for\r\n  the EA video game \"Hot Wheels Turbo Racing\", the USA Network\'s broadcast\r\n  of the 2002 Westminster Dog Show (a big band jazz piece), and the MTV series \r\n\r\n\"Makin\'\r\n  The Band.\" </p>\r\n<p>Alex has been based in New York City since1998. Believing that the learning\r\n  process never ends, he has intertwined all his activities with \r\n\r\nintensive studies.\r\n  This has included earning a BFA in jazz performance from New School University,\r\n  where he studied with master musicians such as Richie Beirach, George \r\n\r\nGarzone,\r\n  Hal Galper and Cecil McBee. His playing combines elements of all the styles\r\n  he enjoys, and his current vision is to continue to record and tour in collaboration\r\n \r\n\r\n with other musicians and as a leader of his own projects. <br />', '<li>Ibanez Sabre (S540)</li>\r\n<li>Gibson Les Paul</li>\r\n<li>Heritige H575 Acoustic</li>', 'www.alexskolnick.com', 'Hypnosis', 'www.AlexSkolnick.com', ' June  10, 2002  @  1:04 PM', 1),

January 24th, 1910 at\r\nLiberchies Belgium, Django was born into the open air, rambling lifestyle of\r\nhis gypsy parents. At the age of eight, his \r\n\r\nmother\'s tribe settled near the belt\r\nof fortifications that surrounded the old Paris, near the Choisy gate. He never\r\nwore a suit or lived in a real house until he was twenty \r\n\r\nyears old. These French\r\nGypsies or Manouches were a world unto themselves, medieval in their beliefs,\r\nand distrustful of modern science. Django grew up in this world of \r\n\r\ncontradictions,\r\none foot in the bustling big city of Paris and the other in the age-old life\r\nof the nomadic gypsy. Though born into poverty Django had the soul of a \r\n\r\nnobleman\r\nand this natural elegance of bearing and attitude expressed itself in his music.\r\n<p>It was at an early age Django became attracted to music. When twelve years\r\n  old \r\n\r\nhe received his first instrument, a banjo/guitar that was given to him\r\n  by a neighbor who had noticed his keen interest in music. He quickly learned\r\n  to play, mimicking the \r\n\r\nfingerings of musicians he watched. He was soon astounding\r\n  adults with his ability on the guitar, and before he was thirteen he began\r\n  his musical career playing with popular \r\n\r\naccordionist Guerino at a dance hall\r\n  on the Rue Monge. He went on to play with numerous other bands and musicians\r\n  and made his first recordings with accordionist Jean \r\n\r\nVaissade for the Ideal\r\n  Company. Since Django could not read or write at the time \"Jiango Renard\" was\r\n  how his name appeared on these records. </p>\r\n<p>On November 2nd, 1928 \r\n\r\nan event took place that would forever change Django\'s\r\n  life. At one o\'clock in the morning the 18 year old Django returned from a\r\n  night of playing music at a new club \"La \r\n\r\nJava\" to the caravan that\r\n  was now the home of himself and his new wife. The caravan was filled with celluloid\r\n  flowers his wife had made to sell at the market on the \r\n\r\nfollowing day. Django\r\n  upon hearing what he thought was a mouse among the flowers bent down with a\r\n  candle to look. The wick from the candle fell into the highly flammable \r\n\r\ncelluloid\r\n  flowers and the caravan was almost instantly transformed into a raging inferno.\r\n  Django wrapped himself in a blanket to shield him from the flames. Somehow\r\n  he \r\n\r\nand his wife made it across the blazing room to safety outside, but his\r\n  left hand, and his right side from knee to waist were badly burned. </p>\r\n<p>Initially doctors wanted to \r\n\r\namputate his leg but Django refused. He was moved\r\n  to a nursing home where the care was so good his leg was saved. Django was\r\n  bedridden for eighteen months. During this time \r\n\r\nhe was given a guitar, and\r\n  with great determination Django created a whole new fingering system built\r\n  around the two fingers on his left hand that had full mobility. His \r\n\r\nfourth\r\n  and fifth digits of the left hand were permanently curled towards the palm\r\n  due to the tendons shrinking from the heat of the fire. He could use them on\r\n  the first \r\n\r\ntwo strings of the guitar for chords and octaves but complete extension\r\n  of these fingers was impossible. His soloing was all done with the index and\r\n  middle fingers! Film \r\n\r\nclips of Django show his technique to be graceful and\r\n  precise, almost defying belief. </p>\r\n<p>Django was influenced by jazz recordings of Eddie Lang and Joe Venuti, Louis\r\n  \r\n\r\nArmstrong and Duke Ellington. This new music found a place deep in Django\'s\r\n  heart. It provided the perfect vehicle for his prodigious talent for improvisation.\r\n  Django \r\n\r\nrarely if ever played a solo the same way twice. Numerous recordings\r\n  prove this to be true. His creative genius was not only that of the master\r\n  improviser, but also that of \r\n\r\nthe composer, and he can be credited with numerous\r\n  pieces with beautiful melodies and sophisticated, subtle harmonic structures.\r\n  However, Django could not read or write \r\n\r\nmusical notation and he was at the\r\n  mercy of others that could to get his ideas down on paper. </p>\r\n<p> 1934 proved to be the most important year of his life. The Quintet of \r\n\r\nthe\r\n  Hot Club of France was born! As the fates would have it, the Quintet was formed\r\n  by a chance meeting of Django and Stephane Grappelly. A band of fourteen musicians\r\n  \r\n\r\nincluding Django, Stephane, Roger Chaput, and Louis Vola were commissioned\r\n  to play at the Hotel Cambridge at teatime. During intermission Django would\r\n  find a corner \r\n\r\nbackstage and play his guitar. One day Stephane joined in and\r\n  both were so pleased with the exchange they went on to play together more and\r\n  more frequently joined by Roger \r\n\r\nChaput (guitar), Louis Vola (bass), and eventually\r\n  Django\'s brother Joseph (guitar). A small record company Ultraphone recorded\r\n  their first sides Dinah, Tiger Rag, Oh Lady \r\n\r\nbe Good, and I Saw Stars. These\r\n  first records caused a sensation! The Quintet went on to record hundreds of\r\n  sides and had a following on both sides of the ocean. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>1939 found the Quintet touring in England when the war broke out. Django returned\r\n  to Paris while Stephane remained in England. Django played and recorded \r\n\r\nthroughout\r\n  the war years substituting Hubert Rostaing\'s clarinet for Stephen\'s violin.\r\n  He somehow avoided the fate of many of his kinfolk who went to their deaths\r\n  in \r\n\r\nthe Nazi concentration camps. After the war he was rejoined by Stephane\r\n  and they again played and recorded. He toured briefly with Duke Ellington in\r\n  America and returned to \r\n\r\nParis where he continued his career until 1951 when\r\n  he retired to the small village of Samois sur Seine. </p>\r\n<p>On May 16th 1953 Django suffered a massive brain hemorrhage \r\n\r\nand died, leaving\r\n  behind his wife Sophie and son Babik. His music remains as vital and exciting\r\n  today as it was when he lived, a legacy of joy to all future generations \r\n\r\nthat\r\n  rediscover the genius of the Belgian gypsy Django Reinhardt.</p>\r\n', '<li>Unknown</li>', 'index.php', 'Honeysuckle Rose', 'RedHotJazz.com', ' June  10, 2002  @  1:04 PM', 1),

Later, at the age\r\nof seven and \r\n\r\ninspired by a Kiss poster, Richie took up playing guitar.\r\n<p>Amazingly by the time Richie reached the age of seventeen, he had traveled\r\n  back and forth across the United States \r\n\r\nplaying in excess of five hundred gigs,\r\n  opening for acts such as the Fabulous Thunderbirds, Greg Allman and the Smithereens.\r\n  It was during that year that Richie released his \r\n\r\nfirst eponymously titled record\r\n  on Shrapnel Records and graced the cover of several publications including\r\n  Guitar World magazine.. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  Richie\'s success and \r\n\r\nvirtuoso playing caught the eye of Bret Michaels, lead\r\n  singer of the multi-platinum act Poison. Richie was asked to join the band\r\n  at the age of twenty. The album Native \r\n\r\nTongue was released in 1993 and achieved\r\n  platinum worldwide sales, and produced two top twenty singles which Richie\r\n  wrote \"Stand\" and \"Until You Suffer Some (Fire and \r\n\r\nIce)\".\r\n  Appearances on numerous national TV shows such as Letterman and The Arsenio\r\n  Hall show followed on the heals of intense MTV coverage. The video for \"Stand\" which\r\n  \r\n\r\nincluded backing vocals by the entire AME Church Choir, was a Top 10 video\r\n  on MTV\'s Most Wanted. Once again Richie graced the covers of numerous magazines.\r\n  A world tour \r\n\r\nfollowed with sold out dates from London to Los Angeles. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  Following a controversial split with Poison, Richie continued his solo career\r\n  releasing albums in \r\n\r\nvarious musical genres ranging from Rock to Soul and ultimately\r\n  Fusion. Richie\'s cult status was also beginning to grow, especially in Japan\r\n  where Richie released classic \r\n\r\nalbums such as \"Wave Of Emotion\" and \"What\r\n  is\". <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  1999 proved to be a crucial year. Legendary fusion bassist Stanley Clarke had\r\n  been approached by Sony \r\n\r\nMusic to put together a new band that could bring Fusion\r\n  into the Millennium. Stanley called on the talents of his old cohort Lenny\r\n  White and set about finding other \r\n\r\nvirtuoso musicians. After exhaustive auditions\r\n  the band \'Vertu\' (pronounced virtue) was ready, Stanley and Lenny where joined\r\n  by Rachel Z (Keyboards), Karen Briggs \r\n\r\n(Violin) and, of course, Richie on guitar.\r\n  A massive tour of Europe commenced on the back the album, providing many of\r\n  Richie\'s fans a chance to see him play in the flesh \r\n\r\nfor the first time since\r\n  his Poison years. Hopefully when Clarke can find time in his busy schedule\r\n  scoring films Vertu will rise again. </p>\r\n<p>Even with having to \r\n\r\nperform with Vertu Richie found time to release two more\r\n  solo albums in 1999, the first a true Blues album \"Bi Polar Blues\" which\r\n  seamlessly mixed classic standards and home \r\n\r\ngrown tunes and the second album \"Break\r\n  It All Down\", released on JVC Victor for Japan, a more up to date sounding\r\n  collection with its feet still firmly seated in the \r\n\r\nBlues.</p>\r\n<p>  1999 also was the year that saw guitarist Paul Gilbert leave the band Mr Big\r\n    wishing to concentrate on more personal matters. With a massive following\r\n    \r\n\r\nin Japan Mr Big\'s remaining band members, Eric Martin, Billy Sheehan and\r\n    Pat Torpey, were under great pressure to find a suitable replacement in time\r\n    to start work on a \r\n\r\nnew album. Having worked together on a previous album\r\n    Sheehan turned to Richie to fill the gap. The aptly titled \"Get Over\r\n    It\" sold more than 175,000 copies in its first \r\n\r\ntwo weeks in Japan and\r\n    was followed by a successful Asian wide tour. </p>\r\n<p>With the release of \"Get Over It\" worldwide and the re-release of\r\n  Richie\'s Asian titles \r\n\r\ninto the American and Europe market the new Millennium\r\n  is set to be an exciting one for both Richie Kotzen and his fans.</p>\r\n', '<li>Fender Telecaster</li>\r\n<li>Fender \r\n\r\nStratocaster</li>\r\n<li>Fender Jazzmaster</li>', 'www.richiekotzen.com', 'Chype Fluxx', 'www.richiekotzen.com | www.mrbig.com', ' June  10, 2002  @  1:04 PM', 6),

As\r\n    always, several items at the group’s merchandise stand featured the image of a white Charvel guitar draped in roses,\r\n    but TSO’s concerts are not the first place this symbol has appeared. In fact, TSO appropriated it—along with several\r\n    of the group’s members, and even its signature song, “Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 12/24”—from the band that spawned TSO\r\n    in unlikely fashion a dozen years ago.</p>\r\n<div id=\"ultimedia_wrapper\"></div>\r\n<p>That band was Savatage, and the Charvel guitar—which first appeared on the back cover of that group’s 1991 album,\r\n    <em>Streets</em>—belonged to its late founding guitarist, Criss Oliva.

His distinctive, self-taught style of playing—marked by gargantuan but catchy\r\n    riffs, crisp and driving rhythms and poignant, emotive solos—was flashy yet simultaneously tasteful. His fans\r\n    included peers such as Dave Mustaine, who once tried to recruit Oliva for Megadeth, and Alex Skolnick.</p>\r\n<p>“[<em>Criss</em>] had the fluidity of guys like George Lynch and Warren DeMartini, but with an aggressive, melodic\r\n    conviction that fit Savatage perfectly,” Skolnick says. “His solos had a flash that would have worked with any\r\n    popular Eighties hard rock band, but his rhythms had an intensity and crunch that were reminiscent of Black Sabbath\r\n    and Deep Purple, and this gave his playing a dark, melodic flavor.”</p>\r\n<p>“Criss’ guitar playing was phenomenal,” adds David Ellefson, Megadeth’s bassist from 1983 to 2002. “You could hear\r\n    his classical roots and appreciate his knowledge and grasp of modal dexterity that was such a huge signature of his\r\n    work. He was a trailblazer in metal guitar the way Randy Rhoads was before him.”</p>\r\n<p>Although Savatage were officially founded in 1983, their roots go back to the mid Seventies, when Criss and his\r\n    brother Jon first began making music together. Criss started out on bass, but after discovering Michael Schenker and\r\n    Ritchie Blackmore, he switched to guitar.</p>\r\n<p>Soon after, the Oliva family moved to Tampa, Florida, where Jon and Criss formed a three-piece band called Tower with\r\n    bassist Tony Ciulla, who today manages Marilyn Manson. With Jon on drums and vocals, Criss on guitar and Ciulla on\r\n    bass, Tower started out playing covers by the likes of Black Sabbath, Van Halen and Rush, acts whose guitarists\r\n    heavily influenced Criss. Eventually, Jon stepped out from behind the kit to become a frontman and the group changed\r\n    its name to Avatar.</p>\r\n<p>Over the next two years (and following several lineup changes), the band started to write original material and began\r\n    to earn a solid following in the Tampa Bay area after it released a three-track seven-inch on local indie Par\r\n    Records. Reviews and sales were encouraging, so Par asked the group to cut a full album. Two days before the record\r\n    went to press, the band learned that another act was already using the moniker Avatar. By combining the name with\r\n    the word “savage,” the Oliva brothers came up with “Savatage.”</p>\r\n<p>The band’s 1983 full-length debut, <em>Sirens</em>, was a landmark recording that mixed classic hard rock and metal\r\n    with elements of thrash and speed metal, genres that were then in their infancy. The album is frequently cited as\r\n    one of the foundations of both power metal and progressive metal and helped spawn Tampa’s prolific music scene.\r\n    (Florida death-metallers Six Feet Under demonstrated Savatage’s local impact by covering the <em>Sirens</em> track\r\n    “Holocaust” on its 2000 release <em>Graveyard Classics</em>.) It was also the first heavy metal album recorded at\r\n    the now legendary Morrisound Studios, which soon became an in-demand destination for renowned metal bands.</p>\r\n<p>Jason Flom, then an A&R rep for Atlantic Records, heard Sirens and was impressed. He flew to Tampa to see\r\n    Savatage perform. “The place was crowded, and the kids were going nuts,” recalls Flom, who is currently president of\r\n    Lava Records. “[<em>Criss</em>] was a great guitar player. He had a very unique style, and he was really, really\r\n    talented.” Flom subsequently brokered a deal to free the group from its recording contract with Par, an arrangement\r\n    that required the group to give the label one more release, the 1984 EP <em>The Dungeons Are Calling</em>. Two of\r\n    its songs—the title track and “City Beneath the Surface”—would provide the opening one-two punch at Savatage\r\n    concerts for years to come.</p>\r\n<p>For the band’s 1985 Atlantic debut, <em>Power of the Night</em>, the label paired Savatage with producer Max Norman,\r\n    then well known for his work on Ozzy Osbourne’s solo albums. The resulting record was more refined than Savatage’s\r\n    two independent releases, but songs like the title track, “Washed Out” and “Skull Session” retained the band’s\r\n    razor-sharp edge and aptly showcased Oliva’s dexterity as a guitarist. The most commercial-sounding track on the\r\n    album was the tongue-in-cheek “Hard for Love,” but it failed to make commercial headway. Atlantic had tried to\r\n    persuade Savatage to change the title to the more radio-friendly “Hot for Love,” but the group refused.</p>\r\n<p>Shortly after completing their first American tour, Savatage began work on their next album, this time at a recording\r\n    studio in London, with new bassist Johnny Lee Middleton in tow. The resulting <em>Fight for the Rock</em> is widely\r\n    seen as the weakest album in the group’s catalog, the result of a tight recording budget, the band’s inexperience\r\n    and poor advice from its managers. Despite the record’s flaws, Criss’ talents shone through, particularly on heavier\r\n    tracks like “Red Light Paradise,” “Hyde” and “The Edge of Midnight.”</p>\r\n<p>On the Fight for the Rock tour, Savatage supported Motörhead in Europe and opened for Ted Nugent in America, but like\r\n    <em>Power of the Night</em>, the album failed to yield a hit. The band’s days with Atlantic seemed numbered until\r\n    A&R rep Flom asked his acquaintance Paul O’Neill to see if he could help the group. O’Neill had worked at\r\n    Leber-Krebs, a management company that had handled Aerosmith, AC/DC and Def Leppard, among others, and he had\r\n    recently become a full-time producer. Following Flom’s example, O’Neill went to Florida to see Savatage perform\r\n    live. He was instantly taken with the band, in particular Criss Oliva. “Criss had a feel that was staggering and a\r\n    sound that was unbelievable,” O’Neill says. “I simply had never heard a better guitar player.”</p>\r\n<p>Soon, O’Neill began collaborating with Savatage on what became 1987’s <em>Hall of the Mountain King</em>. The record\r\n    was widely revered and asserted Savatage as a significant force in the metal scene. Atlantic was relieved when its\r\n    sales far outpaced those of the band’s previous releases. The title track is likely Savatage’s best-known song, but\r\n    other <em>Mountain King</em> tracks featured riffs that were equally memorable. Some of Criss’ finest lead work on\r\n    the album included the riveting ride-out in “24 Hours Ago” and the band’s first full-fledged instrumental, an\r\n    interpretation of Norwegian classical composer Edvard Grieg’s “In the Hall of the Mountain King” titled “Prelude to\r\n    Madness.”</p>\r\n<div class=\"slot-double-height-20-10841\"\r\n    style=\"position: relative; box-sizing: border-box; height: 0px; margin: 0px; text-align: center; pointer-events: none;\">\r\n</div>\r\n<p>In addition to producing <em>Hall of the Mountain King</em>, O’Neill co-wrote much of the album’s material with the\r\n    Oliva brothers, a process that would be repeated on the band’s subsequent albums. In their first writing session,\r\n    O’Neill discovered that his initial assessment of Criss’ talent was accurate. “Criss could play anything you could\r\n    imagine,” he says. “He could work a solo around a vocal without stepping on it, and he was one of the few guitarists\r\n    who knew how to convey the emotion of the human voice with a guitar. He was a combination of the angst of Duane\r\n    Allman on ‘Layla,’ the excitement of Jimmy Page, the emotion of Eric Clapton, the raw feel of Joe Perry and the\r\n    dexterity of [<em>Eddie</em>] Van Halen or [<em>Allan</em>] Holdsworth.”</p>\r\n<div class=\"slot-double-height-19-10110\"\r\n    style=\"position: relative; box-sizing: border-box; height: 0px; margin: 5px -325px 10px 25px; text-align: center; pointer-events: none; transform: none; display: block; contain: layout; float: right; width: 300px;\">\r\n    <div class=\"mgkdiukvktuoqfnl\"\r\n        style=\"flex-flow: row nowrap; justify-content: center; align-items: center; position: relative;\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Shortly after the release of <em>Mountain King</em>, Savatage received its biggest break yet when Dio asked the band\r\n    to open an extensive American arena tour, with Megadeth in the support slot. Ellefson recalls watching Oliva perform\r\n    nightly. “At the end of ‘24 Hours Ago,’ Criss played this bitchin’ diminished lick. Every night, I would stop\r\n    everything I was doing and listen for him to play. It was my favorite lick of the entire tour, the lick I’ll always\r\n    remember him for.”</p>\r\n<div class=\"slot-double-height-18-9641\"\r\n    style=\"position: relative; box-sizing: border-box; height: 0px; margin: 0px; text-align: center; pointer-events: none;\">\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Though the exposure it provided was invaluable, the three-month Dio tour took its toll on Savatage and, in\r\n    particular, Jon, who spent a month in rehab after returning from the road. Save for a handful of one-offs, Savatage\r\n    didn’t tour again for another 18 months.</p>\r\n<div class=\"slot-double-height-17-9378\"\r\n    style=\"position: relative; box-sizing: border-box; height: 0px; margin: 0px; text-align: center; pointer-events: none;\">\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Upon returning to America, Savatage reunited with O’Neill to put the finishing touches on a new record titled\r\n    <em>Gutter Ballet</em>. The name was taken from a musical O’Neill had written years earlier, a manuscript of which\r\n    Criss found by accident in the producer’s New York City home during a break from the studio. The Olivas were so fond\r\n    of both the title and the storyline about a rock star’s rise and fall that they appropriated the musical’s name and\r\n    recorded one of its songs, the dramatic power ballad “When the Crowds Are Gone.” The track was the biggest musical\r\n    risk Savatage had yet taken, and the album marked the group’s move toward progressive metal.</p>\r\n<div class=\"slot-double-height-16-8722\"\r\n    style=\"position: relative; box-sizing: border-box; height: 0px; margin: 0px; text-align: center; pointer-events: none;\">\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Years after its release, Trivium guitarist Corey Beaulieu—who was just six years old when <em>Gutter Ballet</em> was\r\n    released—would discover its appeal. “The record has great songs and memorable hooks, and for a young kid just\r\n    getting into guitar, Criss’ playing was just plain awesome,” Beaulieu says. “Criss’ playing was very smooth, and he\r\n    had a great legato technique. Besides being a great shredder, he had a great melodic feel to his playing.”</p>\r\n<div class=\"interscroller-10-10\" style=\"margin-bottom: 16px; width: 100%; position: relative; z-index: 99999999;\">\r\n    <div class=\"interscroller-10-10-inner\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"slot-double-height-15-8282\"\r\n    style=\"position: relative; box-sizing: border-box; height: 0px; margin: 0px; text-align: center; pointer-events: none;\">\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The album was followed by the Rulin’ Gutter tour, which featured more than 100 dates and was Savatage’s most\r\n    extensive yet. After supporting King Diamond in Europe, the band returned to America to play between Testament and\r\n    Nuclear Assault on a lengthy domestic trek. Criss became friends with Testament’s lead guitarist, Skolnick, but the\r\n    two were already fans of one another. In fact, Skolnick says Criss’ performance on the title track from\r\n    <em>Sirens</em>—which the guitarist says he first heard while in high school—played a significant role in his\r\n    musical development.</p>\r\n<div class=\"slot-double-height-14-7717\"\r\n    style=\"position: relative; box-sizing: border-box; height: 0px; margin: 0px; text-align: center; pointer-events: none;\">\r\n</div>\r\n<p>“Criss inspired me to use octaves in metal riffs and solos, and ‘Sirens’ is a great example of that,” he says. “Criss\r\n    sounded very good on that album, but it was no comparison to where he took his playing a few years later. In fact,\r\n    when I heard <em>Gutter Ballet</em>, I wasn’t even sure it was the same guy at first—his playing had grown by leaps\r\n    and bounds.”</p>\r\n<div class=\"slot-double-height-13-7365\"\r\n    style=\"position: relative; box-sizing: border-box; height: 0px; margin: 0px; text-align: center; pointer-events: none;\">\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Rhythm guitarist Chris Caffery, who first performed with Savatage during the Dio tour, became an official member of\r\n    the band during the <em>Gutter</em> cycle. Over time, he even appropriated some of Criss’ preferences, including his\r\n    use of stainless-steel guitar picks. “They gave an edge to the speed of his picking because of the sharp point on\r\n    the picking side and the material,” Caffery says.</p>\r\n<div class=\"slot-double-height-12-6978\"\r\n    style=\"position: relative; box-sizing: border-box; height: 0px; margin: 0px; text-align: center; pointer-events: none;\">\r\n</div>\r\n<p>For the follow-up to <em>Gutter Ballet</em>, Savatage returned to O’Neill’s musical for inspiration and spent nine\r\n    months tracking their most ambitious album yet, a rock opera titled <em>Streets</em>. The recording bore little\r\n    resemblance to the Savatage that released <em>Sirens</em> eight years prior, but it showcased just how broad Criss’\r\n    palette had grown—the slow build of the riveting solo in “Ghost in the Ruins,” the fierce and undeniable riffs of\r\n    “Agony and Ecstasy” and “Sammy and Tex,” and the triumphant “Believe,” in which he used counterpoint to stirring\r\n    effect.</p>\r\n<div class=\"slot-double-height-11-6428\"\r\n    style=\"position: relative; box-sizing: border-box; height: 0px; margin: 0px; text-align: center; pointer-events: none;\">\r\n</div>\r\n<p>While Jon feels that Streets is Savatage’s artistic pinnacle, it was a commercial setback for the band. Just days\r\n    prior to its release, Nirvana issued their breakthrough, <em>Nevermind</em>. Its success ushered in grunge and\r\n    altered the landscape of guitar-based rock for years. On the road for <em>Streets</em>, Savatage struggled\r\n    financially and were forced to cancel the latter part of the album’s tour.</p>\r\n<div class=\"slot-double-height-10-6040\"\r\n    style=\"position: relative; box-sizing: border-box; height: 0px; margin: 0px; text-align: center; pointer-events: none;\">\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Adding to their problems, Jon was regularly losing his voice in concert, the result of a lack of formal training and\r\n    nonstop vocal abuse over a three-year period. This, combined with the group’s inability to score a hit single,\r\n    convinced him that he was holding Savatage back, and he stepped down as their vocalist.</p>\r\n<div class=\"slot-double-height-9-5725\"\r\n    style=\"position: relative; box-sizing: border-box; height: 0px; margin: 0px; text-align: center; pointer-events: none;\">\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Criss initially pondered making an instrumental album but soon decided to resume working on a new Savatage record\r\n    with O’Neill and Jon, who continued to serve in a cowriting role. Together, they selected Zachary Stevens as Jon’s\r\n    replacement and began recording what would become 1993’s <em>Edge of Thorns</em>. Soon after the album was released,\r\n    drummer Steve Wacholz left the band, leaving Criss as the last remaining original member of Savatage when they\r\n    embarked on the first tour of the <em>Edge of Thorns</em> cycle, a European trek supporting Overkill.</p>\r\n<div class=\"slot-double-height-8-5185\"\r\n    style=\"position: relative; box-sizing: border-box; height: 0px; margin: 0px; text-align: center; pointer-events: none;\">\r\n</div>\r\n<p>By now, Savatage’s music had much more in common with classic hard rock bands of the Seventies than the metal acts of\r\n    the early Eighties, but the songs on <em>Edge of Thorns</em> were still undeniably guitar driven. “Lights Out” and\r\n    “Conversation Piece” contained Criss’ trademark riffing, while the breathtaking ride-out to “He Carves His Stone”\r\n    proved that he could shred better than ever. Jon feels the album is his brother’s best work. “I think he felt a lot\r\n    of pressure and really worked hard to excel and take the focus away from me not being there.”</p>\r\n<div class=\"slot-double-height-7-4638\"\r\n    style=\"position: relative; box-sizing: border-box; height: 0px; margin: 0px; text-align: center; pointer-events: none;\">\r\n</div>\r\n<p>In spite of—or perhaps because of—the grunge-dominated airwaves, <em>Edge of Thorns</em>’ title track became the\r\n    band’s first radio hit, peaking at 26 on <em>Billboard</em>’s Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The airplay and\r\n    subsequent sales, the group’s most brisk since <em>Hall of the Mountain King</em>, also helped Savatage to score\r\n    their biggest tour since Dio: an invitation to open for Vince Neil on his first national headlining tour since\r\n    leaving Mötley Crüe.</p>\r\n<div class=\"slot-double-height-6-4196\"\r\n    style=\"position: relative; box-sizing: border-box; height: 0px; margin: 0px; text-align: center; pointer-events: none;\">\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The album’s second single was to be Savatage’s first acoustic ballad, “Sleep,” and Atlantic—hoping to capitalize of\r\n    the recent chart success of acts like Extreme, Mr. Big and Saigon Kick, the latter two of which were also on the\r\n    label—was prepping a radio campaign around the song. Indeed, it seemed as if Savatage were finally nearing\r\n    mainstream success.</p>\r\n<div class=\"slot-double-height-5-3841\"\r\n    style=\"position: relative; box-sizing: border-box; height: 0px; margin: 0px; text-align: center; pointer-events: none;\">\r\n</div>\r\n<p>But the tour and “Sleep” campaign never took place. In the early morning hours on October 17, 1993, Criss and his\r\n    wife, Dawn, were driving home from a concert near Tampa when an oncoming car struck them head-on while attempting to\r\n    pass another vehicle. Dawn was hospitalized; Criss was killed instantly.</p>\r\n<div class=\"slot-double-height-4-3538\"\r\n    style=\"position: relative; box-sizing: border-box; height: 0px; margin: 0px; text-align: center; pointer-events: none;\">\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The Savatage story should have ended then and there, but against all odds, the band carried on, experienced a\r\n    renaissance in the mid Nineties and found more success overseas than it had previously. Skolnick played a major role\r\n    at first, guesting on the band’s 1994 album <em>Handful of Rain</em> (its first following Criss’ death) and\r\n    participating in the tour that followed, which saw both the addition of drummer Jeff Plate and Jon Oliva’s return as\r\n    vocalist. Caffery returned next, and after Skolnick declined an offer to join the group permanently, journeyman\r\n    guitarist Al Pitrelli (Alice Cooper, Megadeth) joined the fold.</p>\r\n<div class=\"slot-double-height-3-2920\"\r\n    style=\"position: relative; box-sizing: border-box; height: 0px; margin: 0px; text-align: center; pointer-events: none;\">\r\n</div>\r\n<p>For their next album, <em>Dead Winter Dead</em>, Savatage returned to the rock opera format. Among the tracks on the\r\n    album was a holiday-themed instrumental called “Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 12/24.” As the 1995 Christmas holiday season\r\n    unfolded, several pop radio stations across the U.S. unexpectedly began playing the song. In short order, <em>Dead\r\n        Winter Dead</em> became a hot seller and quickly sold out. Unfortunately, the supply couldn’t be replenished\r\n    until after the holidays, and by then, interest in the track had waned.</p>\r\n<div class=\"slot-double-height-2-2410\"\r\n    style=\"position: relative; box-sizing: border-box; height: 0px; margin: 0px; text-align: center; pointer-events: none;\">\r\n</div>\r\n<p>To make the most of their unexpected hit, the group decided to write and record a rock opera with “Christmas Eve” as\r\n    its centerpiece, for release the next holiday season. Fearful that fans would reject the group’s change in musical\r\n    direction and its obvious attempts to capitalize on the track, O’Neill and the members of Savatage decided named\r\n    their new venture the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. Released in October 1996, <em>Christmas Eve and Other Stories</em>\r\n    was, and remains, a smash success. Every TSO release—which to date include four rock operas and one home video—has\r\n    gone at least Gold, something no Savatage album ever accomplished. Meanwhile, TSO’s winter tour is now the country’s\r\n    most attended annual concert tour.</p>\r\n<div class=\"slot-double-height-1-1693\"\r\n    style=\"position: relative; box-sizing: border-box; height: 0px; margin: 5px -325px 10px 25px; text-align: center; pointer-events: none; transform: none; display: block; contain: layout; float: right; width: 300px;\">\r\n    <div class=\"mgkdiukvktuoqfnl\"\r\n        style=\"flex-flow: row nowrap; justify-content: center; align-items: center; position: relative;\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>When TSO performed publicly for the first time in 1999, four members of Savatage—Pitrelli, Caffery, Middleton and\r\n    Plate—and longtime associate Bob Kinkel (who contributed additional keyboards on the band’s albums over the years,\r\n    beginning with <em>Mountain King</em>) anchored the lineup and have continued to do so ever since. Skolnick joined\r\n    them the following year, and he is now a TSO regular.</p>\r\n<div class=\"slot-double-height-0-1305\"\r\n    style=\"position: relative; box-sizing: border-box; height: 0px; margin: 0px; text-align: center; pointer-events: none;\">\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Although Criss Oliva did not play on “Christmas Eve,” one of his guitars did.

People like Criss made everybody around them better musicians—and people like myself a better\r\n    writer—because their talent was so limitless, it drove you to push further and further.”</p>\r\n\r\n', '<h4>\r\nExcerpt from Lory, Dave. Jeff Buckley: From Hallelujah to the Last Goodbye </h2>\r\n<blockquote>\r\nI told him about a guy I had worked with, Chris Oliva, the guitarist with Savatage, who everyone on the tour called “Captain Crunch” because of his biting guitar sound. He went onstage with one distortion pedal nailed to a piece of plywood and got such an incredible tone that Dio and Megadeth both fired their guitar techs, as Chris was getting a better sound.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n <h2>Guitars</h2>\r\n    <p>Criss used several ESP and Jackson/Charvel super strats, but his favorite was nicknamed the Gargoyle. It was an\r\n        ESP that had an ash body, bolt-on unfinished maple neck, 22 medium-jumbo frets, and a Floyd Rose bridge.</p>\r\n    <p>Pickups (humbucker bridge, single-coil neck) were said to be Bartolinis (no models mentioned), but <a\r\n            href=\"http://www.dinosaurrockguitar.com/new/node/43\" target=\"_blank\">dinosaurrockguitar.com had this to\r\n            say</a>: “Deeper investigations suggest that Criss used Seymour Duncan JBs in the bridge position.” Then\r\n        there’s the DiMarzio quote above….</p>\r\n    <p>Strings were LaBella Hard Rockin’ Steels (no longer made), with the following gauges:<br>\r\n        > Standard tuning: 9-42<br>\r\n        > Drop D: 9-46<br>\r\n        > Whole step down (D to D): 10-48<br>\r\n        > Drop C (including Hall of the Mountain King): 10-52</p>\r\n    <p>He used stainless-steel picks apparently made by StarPiks, which I believe is now out of business.</p>\r\n    <h2>Effects</h2>\r\n    <p>Like all guitarists, Criss used various effects throughout his career. But it appears his “standard” pedalboard\r\n        had the following components, in addition to a tuner:</p>\r\n    <p>> 2 Boss Super Overdrives – Both all the way up except one had the Tone rolled all the way off and the other\r\n        had the Tone all the way up.</p>\r\n    <p>> Boss Chorus CE-2 (Rate at 10:30, Depth up all the way).</p>\r\n    <p>> 2 Boss TU-12H Chromatic tuner.</p>\r\n    <p>> Boss Power Supply, which powered the entire pedalboard.</p>\r\n    <p>> A/B switch</p>\r\n    <p>Chris also had rack processors, which at various times included:</p>\r\n    <p>> Compressor (unnamed)</p>\r\n    <p>> Rockman Stereo Chorus and/or Sustainer (used as a clean pre-amp boost)</p>\r\n    <p>> Ibanez delay (presumably the one on eBay)</p>\r\n    <p>> Peavey 31-band stereo EQ, settings frequently changed but apparently the gain always all the way up.</p>\r\n    <p>Other rack-mount units were used, including a noise gate and possibly reverb.</p>\r\n    <h2>Amps</h2>\r\n    <p>Even though Criss’ tech mentions a Yamaha above (again, no specifics), everyone else talks about Crhis using\r\n        Marshalls (presumably JCM 800s, possibly hot-rodded) and Laneys: Laney Pro Tube and AOR Pro Tube 50-watters.</p>\r\n    <p>Cabs were supposedly Marshall and/or Laney. No word on speakers.</p>\r\n    <p>The aforementioned Criss fan sites say: “Criss ran his amps on the clean channel only,” or the lower-gain of\r\n        two-input, presumably single-channel amps.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>Hall of the Mountain King, Live, Cleveland, 1987</strong><br>\r\n        <object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\"\r\n            codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\">\r\n            <param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\">\r\n            <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\">\r\n            <param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/wPYRyqlplW8&hl=en&fs=1&\">\r\n            <param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\"><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"480\"\r\n                height=\"385\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/wPYRyqlplW8&hl=en&fs=1&\"\r\n                allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></object></p>\r\n    <h2>Notable</h2>\r\n    <p>> Here’s <a href=\"http://www.guitarworld.com/article/criss_oliva_mountain_king?page=0%2C0\" target=\"_blank\">a\r\n            good Guitar World article</a> on Criss.</p>\r\n    <p>> On his sound (from <a href=\"http://www.realsavatage.com/criss/interviews/art.RHde_5.93.shtml\"\r\n            target=\"_blank\">this 1993 interview</a>): “I’m always working hard on my sound and am constantly trying to\r\n        improve it. I have Laney amps, Jackson guitars, a small rack. And that’s not even specially adjusted. That’s\r\n        all…. There’s no mystery. And if any, then it’s hidden between hands, heart and soul. It simply must be the way\r\n        I play.”</p>\r\n    <p>> Amazingly, I don’t think Criss was ever interviewed by any major guitar magazine. (If any of you know for\r\n        sure, please leave a comment!)</p>\r\n    <p>> In <a href=\"http://www.realsavatage.com/criss/interviews/art.Flash-IT_12.93.htm\" target=\"_blank\">this\r\n            interview</a>, Criss indicates that his favorite guitarist was Jimmy Page. His favorite album: Physical\r\n        Graffiti.</p>\r\n    <p>> In the same interview Criss was asked how he would like to be remembered. He said: “As a great composer, a\r\n        capable guitarist and a nice person.”</p>\r\n    <p><strong>Edvard Grieg’s In the Hall of the Mountain King </strong><br>', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criss_Oliva', 'Gutter Ballet', 'Guitar World, 2009', ' March  01, 2020  @  6:14 PM', 1);
