# GBase

GBase is simple database system written in PHP/MySQL. It contains all the basic C.R.U.D functions and has been designed so that additional functionality for storing configuration parameters, changing styles, etc. While it does have basic password controls for adding and editing data, it is not security friendly and has no sanitization of user inputs, hash/salts of passwords, or other safeguards in place. I offer it as an example project for anyone looking to learn more about how PHP/MySQL be used together to create a simple database application.
